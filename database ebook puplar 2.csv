It’s about the language of video and how to think like a director, regardless of equipment (amateurs think about the camera, pros think about communication). It’s about the rules developed over a century of movie-making—which work just as well when shooting a two-year-old’s birthday party on your phone. Written by Steve Stockman, the director of the award-winning feature Two Weeks, plus TV shows, music videos, and hundreds of commercials, How to Shoot Video That Doesn’t Suck explains in 74 short, pithy, insightful chapters how to tell a story and entertain your audience. In other words, how to shoot video people will want to watch.

 Here’s how to think in shots—how to move-point-shoot-stop-repeat, instead of planting yourself in one spot and pressing “Record” for five minutes. Why never to shoot until you see the whites of your subject’s eyes. Why to “zoom” with your feet and not the lens. How to create intrigue on camera. The book covers the basics of video production: framing, lighting, sound (use an external mic), editing, special effects (turn them off!), and gives advice on shooting a variety of specific situations: sporting events, parties and family gatherings, graduations and performances. Plus, how to make instructional and promotional videos, how to make a music video, how to capture stunts, and much more. At the end of every chapter is a suggestion of how to immediately put what you’ve learned into practice, so the next time you’re shooting you’ll have begun to master the skill. Steve’s website (stevestockman.com) provides video examples to illustrate different production ideas, techniques, and situations, and his latest thoughts on all things video."

the vast majority of traders, and active investors for that matter, are losers – or, at best, marginal winners. Some people pay educators up to $20000 to help them find an edge or the secret to generating profits in the markets. they listen to poor advice, perhaps from non-licensed practitioners, and rarely take any responsibility for their own actions. if you are like many other beginners, you probably already feel as though you've been through the ringer, trying many different methods and reading any book you could get your hands on. i call this the beginner's cycle – moving back and forth between methods and ideas that just never eventuate into any concrete or consistent profits. it can be an expensive and long journey but, more importantly, it's an extremely frustrating journey that causes many to give up.
by the end of this book you will be thinking like a professional trader, operating as a business manager rather than a gambler.

You should have three different versions of your resume: the fancy version (formatted for printing), the copy-and-paste text version (formatted for pasting into website text-boxes), and the complete version (including the salary histories, the phone numbers, and the exact addresses for every position on your resume because some website applications require all of this information)13. If an online application requires that you re-type your entire resume over again into their website, then you must do this if you want to be considered for the position, without skipping any pieces - otherwise, it acts as a filter to disqualify the applicants who didn’t want it bad enough26. More power verbs - advised, assessed, assisted, budgeted, contracted, created, devised, decreased, expanded, fixed, increased, inspected, learned, maintained, managed, met, named, negotiated, participated, planned, promoted, received, reduced, staffed, started, streamlined, taught, tracked, transformed, worked51. Acronyms - do not assume that the reader knows what the letters stand for, so the first time you mention an organization, write it completely out, with the acronym in parentheses, for example, “US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)” - and then you can use the acronym alone54. Customization - use the exact same wording in the cover letter that is in the job post - never send a stock cover letter"

to start GTD, or who tried it, but doesn't work. 

I am a software engineer. I always need to thrash out the tasks in my work. 

I list up the operation as task, check it it's done or not, and know the progress for the project. 

The thrashing out the tasks is the most important factor for that the project goes well. 

GTD declare the process how to act with the complete details. 

""Collecting"" -> ""Handling"" -> ""Arrangement"" -> ""Review"" -> ""Exception"" 

It is easy way to clear up the work flow for anybody. And all you need is paper and pencil. 

""LifeHacks"" is appropriate word for it. 

But, I realized it's really hard to keep doing it. There is no problem during the process ""Collect"". 

And we have to write it down to another piece of paper in the processes, ""Handling"", and 

""Arrangement"". It's really troublesome. We get stressed by writing the task twice. 

And it is also hard to connect task and schedule. If the task has to be done at some later date, you need to entry the task to your schedule of your notebook or PC. But it is going to be troublesome. It is hard to connect task and schedule smoothly. 

Recently there are some ways to digitalize GTD. There is the way which you manage TODO on the web or with the cell phone. The other way is managing mail as tasks by using Gmail. 

I used to manage TODO and schedule by using PDA. But it was so hard to keep doing it because I got some stressed by writing the data. 

I had to turn on the PDA, open the scheduler, input the characters, and save it only for 20 characters. 

I guess this is the problem why I couldn't keep doing it.

They stop short of starting a real business though most could be the first step in just such a direction. I'll also provide answers to questions such as, ""Do you need a license?"" and ""What about income tax?"""

The book does not assume any specialized knowledge by the reader, but adopts a patient and helpful tone in explaining topics such as autofocus, manual focus, aperture priority, shutter priority, macro photography, and RAW files. The book’s numerous photographs provide illustrations of the camera’s controls and menus, and also include examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the My Color shooting mode, which lets the photographer alter the color processing of images; the Scene modes, with settings that are optimized for various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and sports; and special features such as the Multiple Exposure and High Dynamic Range settings. In addition, the book goes beyond the realm of everyday photography, and provides introductions to more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, digiscoping, astrophotography, and creating 3D images that can be viewed with conventional red and blue 3D glasses. These discussions provide detailed information about the equipment or software and procedures needed for these activities, and include illustrative photographs. The book also includes a full discussion of the exceptional capabilities of the Leica D-Lux 5 camera in recording video. The book describes the various settings for video recording and when to use them, including a discussion of the advanced manual video recording settings that the camera provides, including a shutter speed as fast as 1/20,000 second and as slow as 1/8 second.

The man who predicted the worst economic crisis in US history shows you how to survive it.

The current crisis is not like 2008 or even 1929. The New Depression that has emerged from the COVID pandemic is the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. Most fired employees will remain redundant. Bankruptcies will be common, and banks will buckle under the weight of bad debts. Deflation, debt, and demography will wreck any chance of recovery, and social disorder will follow closely on the heels of market chaos. The happy talk from Wall Street and the White House is an illusion. The worst is yet to come. 

But for knowledgeable investors, all hope is not lost. 

In The New Great Depression, James Rickards, New York Times bestselling author of Aftermath and The New Case for Gold, pulls back the curtain to reveal the true risks to our financial system and what savvy investors can do to survive -- even prosper -- during a time of unrivaled turbulence. Drawing on historical case studies, monetary theory, and behind-the-scenes access to the halls of power, Rickards shines a clarifying light on the events taking place, so investors understand what's really happening and what they can do about it. 

A must-read for any fans of Rickards and for investors everywhere who want to understand how to preserve their wealth during the worst economic crisis in US history."

Think about your most costly and recurring trading mistakes. Chances are that they’re related to common errors, such as chasing price, cutting winners short, forcing mediocre trades, and overtrading. You’ve likely tried to fix these errors by improving your technical skills, and yet they persist. That’s because the real source of these mistakes is not technical—they actually stem from greed, fear, anger, or problems with confidence and discipline.

 

If you are like most traders, you probably overlook or misunderstand mental and emotional obstacles. Or worse, you might think you know how to manage them, but you don’t, and end up losing control at the worst possible time. You’re leaving too much money on the table, which will either prevent you from being profitable or realizing your potential.

 

While many trading psychology books offer sound advice, they don’t show you how to do the necessary work. That’s why you haven’t solved the problems hurting your performance. With straight talk and practical solutions, Jared Tendler brings a new voice to trading psychology. In The Mental Game of Trading, he busts myths about emotions, greed, and discipline, and shows you how to look past the obvious to identify the real reasons you’re struggling.

 

This book is different from anything else on the market. You’ll get a step-by-step system for discovering the cause of your problems and eliminating them once and for all. And through real stories of traders from around the world who have successfully used Tendler’s system, you’ll learn how to tackle your problems, improve your day-to-day performance, and increase your profits.

 

Whether you’re an independent or institutional trader, and regardless of whether you trade equities, forex, or cryptocurrencies, you can use this system to improve your decision-making and execution. Finally, you have a way to reach your potential as a trader. Now’s the time to make it happen."

누가 거짓말하는지 알기 위해서는 경제적 관점의 눈을 떠야만 한다. 그것을 뜨지 못하면, 언론에서 인정받는 2명의 경제 전문가가 팽팽한 대립을 할 때, 일반인은 사람을 보고서 판단을 내려야하는 위험에 처하게 된다. 결국 모르면 손실, 알면 유익인 것이다. 경제는 생활과 너무 밀접한 관련이 있기 때문에 모르면 손해, 알면 이익을 보게 된다. 이 책은 경제적 전문 용어를 설명한 책이 아니다. 결코 그런 책이 아니다. 사람으로 하여금 경제의 눈을 뜨게 하는 책이다.

After serving 24 years on active duty as an enlisted Marine, Tim converted his military experience into the hours needed to qualify for the PMP Exam, passed the test, was awarded the PMP credential, and has enjoyed a lucrative career as a project manager and trainer ever since.

As you might imagine, writing a Broadway musical has its challenges. But it turns out there are challenges one can’t begin to imagine when collaborating with two rock legends and a superstar director to stage the biggest, most expensive production in theater history. Renowned director Julie Taymor picked playwright Glen Berger to cowrite the book for a $25 million Spider-Man musical. Together—along with U2’s Bono and Edge—they would shape a work that was technically daring and emotionally profound, with a story fueled by the hero’s quest for love…and the villains’ quest for revenge. Or at least, that’s what they’d hoped for.

But when charismatic producer Tony Adams died suddenly, the show began to lose its footing. Soon the budget was ballooning, financing was evaporating, and producers were jumping ship or getting demoted. And then came the injuries. And then came word-of-mouth about the show itself. What followed was a pageant of foul-ups, falling-outs, ever-more harrowing mishaps, and a whole lot of malfunctioning spider legs. This “circus-rock-and-roll-drama,” with its $65 million price tag, had become more of a spectacle than its creators ever wished for. During the show’s unprecedented seven months of previews, the company’s struggles to reach opening night inspired breathless tabloid coverage and garnered international notoriety.

Through it all, Berger observed the chaos with his signature mix of big ambition and self-deprecating humor."

There are many aspects of modern life that trouble award-winning comedian David Mitchell, such as: 

Why is every film or TV programme a sequel or a remake? 

Why are people so f***ing hung up about swearing? 

Why do the asterisks in that sentence make it ok? 

Why do so many people want to stop other people doing things, and how can they be stopped from stopping them?

Join Mitchell on a tour of the absurdities of our times - from Ryanair to Richard III, Downton Abbey to phone etiquette, UKIP to hotdogs made of cats. Funny, provocative and shot through with refreshing amounts of common sense, Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse celebrates and commiserates on the state of things in our not entirely glorious modern world.

Technological advances are happening at a rate faster than our ability to understand them, and in a world that moves faster than we can imagine, we cannot afford to stand still. These advances bring efficiency and abundance—and they are profoundly deflationary.Our economic systems were built for a pre-technology era when labour and capital were inextricably linked, an era that counted on growth and inflation, an era where we made money from inefficiency. That era is over, but we keep on pretending that those economic systems still work.The only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend—and with it, debt that we will never be able to pay back. As we try to artificially drive an economic system built for the past, we are creating more than just economic trouble.On our current path, our world will become profoundly more polarized and unsafe. We need to build a new framework for our local and global economies, and soon; we need to accept deflation and embrace the abundance it can bring. Otherwise, the same technology that has the power to bring abundance to us and our world will instead destroy it.In this extraordinary contrarian book, Jeff Booth, a leading mind and CEO in e-commerce and technology for 20 years, details the technological and economic realities shaping our present and our future, and the choices we face as we go forward—a potentially alarming, but deeply hopeful situation."

 What is the magic glue that adheres consumers to Google, Mini Cooper, and Oprah, but not to others? Why do many brands with great product innovation, perfect locations, terrific customer experiences, even breakthrough advertising fail to get the same visceral traction in the marketplace that brands like Apple, Starbucks, or Nike have? After years of working with famous brands like Absolut, Ford Motor Company, LEGO, Disney, Montblanc, Sara Lee, and others, Patrick Hanlon, senior advertising executive and founder of Thinktopia, decided to find the answers. His search revealed seven definable assets that together construct the belief system that lies behind every successful brand, whether it's a product, service, city, personality, social cause, or movement. 

 In Primal branding, Hanlon explores those seven components, known as the primal code, and shows how to use and combine them to create a community of believers in which the consumer develops a powerful emotional attachment to the brand. These techniques work for everyone involved in creating and selling an image -- from marketing managers to social advocates to business leaders seeking to increase customer preference for new or existing products. Primal branding presents a world of new possibility for everyone trying to spark public appeal -- and the opportunity to move from being just another product on the shelf to becoming a desired and necessary part of the culture."

A sudden death in the family delivers Julia Parry a box of love letters. Dusty with age, they reveal an illicit affair between the celebrated Irish novelist, Elizabeth Bowen, and the academic Humphry House - Julia’s grandfather. So begins a life-changing quest to discover and understand this affair, one with profound repercussions for Julia’s family, not least her grandmother, Madeline.


Using fascinating unpublished correspondence, Julia follows the lives of three very different characters through some of the most dramatic decades of the twentieth century: from the rarefied air of Oxford in the 1930s and the Anglo-Irish Big House, to the last days of Empire in India and into the Second World War. The story opens up a lost world, one with complex and often surprising attitudes to love and sex, work and home, duty and ambition, and to writing itself, spiced throughout with social history and a celebrated supporting cast that includes Isaiah Berlin and Virginia Woolf.


Inspired by Bowen’s own obsession with place and memory, Julia travels to all the locations in the letters - from Kolkata to Cambridge; from Ireland to Texas weaving present-day storytelling with historical narrative and literary exploration.


From an assured, elegant new voice, The Shadowy Third is a beautifully written investigation of family, love, and the lasting power of literature.


Praise for The Shadowy Third

‘Julia Parry has a fascinating tale to tell, and she does so with a compelling immediacy and also with admirable finesse. Bowen fans will be in her debt; and those interested in the milieux she frequented.’ Peter J. Conradi

‘The Shadowy Third is the intimate portrait of a love triangle, with the novelist Elizabeth Bowen as one of the protagonists. It is also a work of discovery, using letters with sensitivity and intelligence, rebuilding a lost world with imaginative flair, seeing Bowen and her world with insight, and the lives of Julia Parry’s own grandparents with a sharp eye for detail and a skill at telling a fascinating story.‘ Colm Tóibín, author of The Empty Family

‘A vivid picture of an important and immensely gifted writer in love.’ Joseph O’Connor

‘A compelling story of marriage, passion and betrayal that reads like a richly textured novel. With skill, wit, and empathy, Parry takes readers on a compelling journey to find the truth of her grandfather’s love affair with a famous novelist. Gripping, poignant, and fascinating.’ Charlotte Gordon, author of Romantic Outlaws: The Extraordinary Lives of Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley"

Fritzy was Jake’s trainer. I had got his mobile number from Jake, but put off dialling it for two days, afraid my voice would betray me as soft, privileged and generally unsuitable for instruction. When I did finally work up the nerve to call, I half-hoped nobody would pick up. But on the fifth ring, a voice, broad and rasping, answered: ‘Fritzy here.’


‘G’day,’ I said, affecting the same kind of matey, flat-vowelled intonation my dad uses when talking to his mechanic. ‘I was calling about getting some boxing lessons for me and a mate?’



The sport of boxing provokes love, loathing and sometimes lust with equal intensity. It’s a ticket out of poverty, a middle-class fascination and a promoter’s goldmine; it can hook people with a primal burst of adrenaline and clinch them tight, or repel them utterly from the first jab. 

In On the Chin Alex McClintock uses his own unlikely progress through the amateur ranks as a springboard to explore the history, culture and contradictions of the sweet science—with detours through some of its notable characters, including: Benny ‘The Ghetto Wizard’ Leonard, ‘The Boxing Barista’ Luigi Coluzzi, the immaculately named Trenton Titsworth, and the great Ruben Olivares, once described as ‘the undisputed champion of the bender and the cabaret’.

Informative, insightful and effortlessly entertaining, On the Chin is your essential guide to the art of hitting and getting hit.

Alex McClintock grew up in Sydney, Australia, and now lives in Toronto, Canada. His writing has appeared in the Guardian, the Globe and Mail, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Monthly. On the Chin: A Boxing Education is his first book.

‘The sweet science of boxing has gifted us the best work of some of the finest writers in literature. And now Alex McClintock has deepened that dark, mysterious well of beautiful writing about the most brutal of sports.’ John Birmingham

‘Compelling - I was left hooked until the final bell.’ David Hunt

‘I thought I wasn’t interested in boxing, and then I read this book. Completely engrossing, thoughtful and at times touching; you will learn about boxing but you will also learn a little more about the world we live in, and why we can be brought together by people hitting each other. Alex’s writing is something to behold.’ Bridie Jabour

‘A beautifully written portal into a sometimes misunderstood sport. Alex McClintock’s On the Chin illuminates a world that has a rich cast of heroes and villains, and his own journey into that tribe. A treat for boxing fans and non-fans alike.’ 
Brigid Delaney

‘On the Chin is a rare work, in that it made me enthusiastic about hitting other people. Yes, this is a book about the dance and technical beauty of boxers in the ring but McClintock’s insight into the human drive – the ambition to punch and be punched – makes this sing. In reading this, we hear the echoes of race, poverty and the funeral song of great fighters who razed all before them but never ended up truly winning. Alex had me laughing and wincing reflexively. Then, most powerfully, I began wondering if maybe this fighting business was something I should try. He’s that good.’ Rick Morton

‘Alex McClintock has written an evocative and engaging boxing memoir rich in the history and pathos of the fight game, filled with riveting and illuminating detail about his own attempts to become a boxer.’ Donald McRae"

Often downplayed in the excitement of starting up a new business venture is one of the most important decisions entrepreneurs will face: should they go it alone, or bring in cofounders, hires, and investors to help build the business? More than just financial rewards are at stake. Friendships and relationships can suffer. Bad decisions at the inception of a promising venture lay the foundations for its eventual ruin. The Founder's Dilemmas is the first book to examine the early decisions by entrepreneurs that can make or break a startup and its team.

Drawing on a decade of research, Noam Wasserman reveals the common pitfalls founders face and how to avoid them. He looks at whether it is a good idea to cofound with friends or relatives, how and when to split the equity within the founding team, and how to recognize when a successful founder-CEO should exit or be fired. Wasserman explains how to anticipate, avoid, or recover from disastrous mistakes that can splinter a founding team, strip founders of control, and leave founders without a financial payoff for their hard work and innovative ideas. He highlights the need at each step to strike a careful balance between controlling the startup and attracting the best resources to grow it, and demonstrates why the easy short-term choice is often the most perilous in the long term.

The Founder's Dilemmas draws on the inside stories of founders like Evan Williams of Twitter and Tim Westergren of Pandora, while mining quantitative data on almost ten thousand founders.

In 1943, with Lvov's 150,000 Jews having been exiled, killed, or forced into ghettos and facing extermination, a group of Polish Jews daringly sought refuge in the city's sewer system.

The task of explaining the causes of the wealth of the people in a society is a long and complex subject for a single e-book. To facilitate the explanation and the delivery of the material, an e-book will be published in each set of topics.
The following are the planned titles of the book series:

Your Wealth
The first book looks at the time savings gained by a single person increasing his physical and mind assets in an island.

The Wealth of Your Neighbor
The second book is about the agreements that two people have to make to be in a path to increase their respective wealth.

The Wealth of the Market
The third book explains the opportunities offered by a free market to produce wealth for the people that participate in it. This book explains the wealth production results when there is a market that brings the competitive advantage of every individual to the market.

The Wealth of the Business Enterprise
The fourth book is about the function of the business enterprise to produce wealth for its customers, its owners, and its employees.

The Wealth of the State
The fifth book discusses what happens when we remove the assumption that everybody is going to behave correctly. The book explores the historical formation of the state and the implications for the production of wealth.

The Wealth of Social Capital
The sixth book is the core of the series. Social Capital is defined as the ability of a society to learn and agree on the rules that are necessary for the production of wealth. This is the key for the wealth of the people in society. This is the ingredient that is a prerequisite for physical and human capital formation and the ingredient missing in many countries that are not able to achieve wealth.

The Wealth of Physical Capital
The seventh book is about the wealth of the physical capital that humanity has today. It should make you grateful that you live in this age and not five hundred or five thousand years ago.

The Wealth of Human Capital
The eighth book is about the wealth of the human capital that humanity has today. A great deal of the human capital available is taken for granted and it is wasted so it will be good to review it.

The Wealth of a Nation
The ninth book takes us to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. A nation is an entity that comprises a geographical area with a legal setting. It is governed by a state that is the keeper of the social contract. The state maintains the rules of a nation’s social capital and thus determines the capital structure of the nation and its citizens and in this way the state determines the income of its citizens.

The Wealth of the Planet Earth
The tenth book is about our planet. It introduces the concept of Natural Capital. What we think as natural resources is actually the capitalization of life that has been happening for millions of years. Unfortunately, many of the actions that we do in the pursuit of wealth production reduce the planet’s natural capital. If the planet was treated as a capital asset, it would be maintained correctly and it would not be consumed risking a drop of the whole world to a lower income level.

The Wealth of the Human Spirit
The eleventh book will be an inquiry about what these economic principles might mean for the spiritual world."

King of Pop. Voice of the common man. Australian of the Year. Friend. Icon. Superstar.



John Farnham is the quintessential Aussie legend. As a teenager he gave up an apprenticeship to chase his musical dreams, hitting the big time with ‘Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)’. A family man at heart, and the most loyal of friends, John was sometimes uncomfortable with the spotlight and for many years struggled to take his career to the heights that those close to him, including Molly Meldrum and Glenn Wheatley, felt it could reach.



He finally hit his stride with 1986’s Whispering Jack and the breakaway success of ‘You’re the Voice’, which became the anthem of a generation. John lived it up – holidaying with the Skases and dining at the Lodge with Bob Hawke – but always came back down to earth.

He is often called England's national poet and the ""Bard of Avon"" (or simply ""the Bard"")


Othello (The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1603. It is based on the story Un Capitano Moro (""A Moorish Captain"") by Cinthio (a disciple of Boccaccio's), first published in 1565. The story revolves around its two central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army, and his treacherous ensign, Iago. Given its varied and enduring themes of racism, love, jealousy, betrayal, revenge, and repentance, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theatre alike, and has been the source for numerous operatic, film, and literary adaptations."

Whether you’re an experienced professional willing to take your career to the next level or a student looking for your first job … this book can give you an extra boost to succeed!

Why?

Throughout 10+ years experience in coaching and employment counseling, the author noticed several common themes that act like blind spots on the job hunting process. 

The most important one? Misunderstanding the factors that influence the hiring decision, leading to more time and energy spent on getting the desired results.

When you open yourself up to understanding the others’ perspective (employers, recruiters, services providers), you’ll be more willing to adjust your job search accordingly—which increases your chances to get hired!

What you’ll find inside:

- Employers’ point of view on the recruitment process, and factors that influence their decision

- Recruiters’ perspective, and how their services could affect your job search

- Service Providers’ point of view (employment counselors, career coaches, etc.), and how to benefit the most from their services

- Several job search tips for the introverted and shy, addressing their specific challenges

- Blind spots of the candidates’ perspective, and how to uncover their wisdom to accelerate your job search!

Through this book, you'll also get access to ”You’re Hired: The Faster Way to Find a Job” (e-book) to learn a powerful coaching concept - often overlooked - that will accelerate your job search!

What’s not included in this book:

- How to leverage your strengths to attract the employer’s attention

- Twenty-one efficient job search strategies

- Detailed tips and advice on each phase of the job hunting process

- How to save time by applying project management concepts to your job search

- Attitudes for effective communication during the interview

- How to combine online and offline job search strategies to get better results (like the proactive use of LinkedIn’s website to figure out the next offline step).

The last 6 points are covered in Gabriela’s international bestseller ”Introverts: Leverage Your Strengths for an Effective Job Search”

EDITORIAL REVIEWS

”The author skillfully presents the job search journey from different perspectives. Whether you've read tons of literature on the subject before opening this book or not, be prepared for an epiphany; like that individual mentioned in the book who was so tired of unsuccessful job hunting that he avoided eye contact due to his self-confidence vanishing… until his coach (incidentally the author) gave him an advice that changed the way he perceived himself. A must read!“  ~ F.K.

”This is not just a book about understanding the perspectives of the employer. It will also help the job seekers ask and reflect on themselves, their approach, strategies, and attitude in the job hunting process. I love the practicality of this book as it's also based on the first-hand experience of the author which makes the book a more interesting read. It is clearly written and enriched with examples and tips to make one understand the cycle of the hiring process and most importantly the employer's point of view. Every job seeker should have this book.” ~ E.M."

He knows how to sucker the rubes and flash the ol' hamster-outta-the-fedora every now and then, to baffle 'em and dazzle 'em. But he didn't expect a naive fan like Jake, who wants to learn Harry's Old Knowledge - ""real"" magic. Harry's archenemy obliterates Jake's girlfriend, forcing Jake to become a wizard, just to stay alive. Will Jake use his newfound powers for vengeance? The timeless myth of the Sorcerer's Apprentice unfolds against the backdrop of the Magic Castle and the Hollywoodland sign.

Lineage: 12th-century folklore myths begat The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, which begat a tone poem by composer Paul Dukás, which begat Disney's Fantasia, which inspired Merlinsky, a magical action-adventure. [Completed before the Nicolas Cage film was released.]

The universal lament about money is that there is  never enough. We spend endless hours obsessing over our budgets and investments,  trying to figure out ways to stretch every dollar. We try to follow the advice  of money gurus and financial planners, then kick ourselves whenever we spend too  much or save too little. For all of the stress and effort we put into every  choice, why are most of us unhappy about our finances?

According to Laura  Vanderkam, the key is to change your perspective. Instead of looking at money as  a scarce resource, consider it a tool that you can use creatively to build a  better life for yourself and the people you care about.  

For instance, the average couple  spends $5,000 on engagement and wedding rings, making these pricey purchases  largely because everyone else does. But what if you decided to spend $300 on  rings and apply the rest to future date nights, weekend getaways, and  thinking-of-you bouquets over the next ten years? In he long run, what would  bring more joy to your marriage? Likewise, will owning a home with a pristine  lawn and a two-car garage—the American Dream—really make you more satisfied? Or  are you saving up for this investment just because financial planners tell you  it’s worth it?

Vanderkam shows how each of us can  figure out better ways to use what we have to build the lives we want. Drawing  on the latest happiness research as well as the stories of dozens of real  people, Vanderkam offers a contrarian approach that forces us to examine our own  beliefs, goals, and values.

Among her  advice:

Laugh at the Joneses:  It’s human nature to compare yourself to those around you, but you can create  lifestyle hat rings you personal satisfaction without copying your  neighbors.
    Give yourself the best  weekend ever: Studies show that experiences often bring more pleasure than  material goods. With a little planning and creativity, you can give yourself a  memorable getaway without leaving town or going broke.        Embrace the selfish joy  of giving: Giving back not only helps you build karma, it also helps you build a  community—which is much more fulfilling than a tax deduction. All the Money in  the World is a practical and inspiring guide that shows how money can buy  happiness—if we spend it wisely."

It's a short, precise look at how one can save money. It doesn't contain stuff like ""how to make drinkware by cutting your empty wine bottles in half"" or ""reuse that empty milk carton for covering your young tender transplants"", even though those are both ways to save money.
What we deal with in this book is basic common sense ways to live a frugal lifestyle. Living frugally is like dieting... only when you make it a chosen lifestyle will you see real results that work. By learning these steps early in life, your outlook on spending will narrow and you'll be able to easily save for that rainy day or for your retirement.
All of the ways I've listed have been tested in my own life and have given proven results. Although these ideas are very basic and very simple, they will guide you to a life of simplicity and calmness. You'll be able to retire long before others who just can't seem to stretch their savings enough to feel comfortable taking that big step.
Some people tell me that this book has nothing new in it... and that might be true. Learning how to live a frugal life is an easy, basic lesson in life and any book that promotes this idea should have all of these key points in it. (There is only so many ways one can teach this lesson.) What this book has that others don't... is simplicity. It is short and to the point. You can read it in an afternoon and come away with some good ideas that make sense. I hope you'll enjoy this gift of hope... and learn to live that frugal lifestyle."

Today, government and business leaders are facing the twin questions of how to prevent similar crises in the future and how to guide their economies through the looming and lengthy process of debt reduction, or deleveraging.

To help address these questions, the McKinsey Global Institute launched a research effort to understand the growth of debt and leverage before the crisis in different countries, the economic consequences of deleveraging, and the practical implications for policy makers, financial regulators, and business executives. In the course of the research, MGI created an extensive fact base on debt and leverage in each sector of ten mature economies and four emerging economies. In addition, MGI analyzed 45 historic episodes of deleveraging, in which an economy significantly reduced its total debt-to-GDP ratio, that have occurred since 1930. This analysis adds new details to the picture of how leverage grew around the world before the crisis and how the process of reducing it could unfold."

Working women today are better educated and more well qualified than ever before. Yet men still predominate in the corporate world. In The Confidence Code, Claire Shipman and Katty Kay argue that the key reason is confidence.

Combining cutting-edge research in genetics, gender, behavior, and cognition—with examples from their own lives and those of other successful women in politics, media, and business—Kay and Shipman go beyond admonishing women to ""lean in.""Instead, they offer the inspiration and practical advice women need to close the gap and achieve the careers they want and deserve."

From the optimizing individual to game theory to price theory, The Cartoon Introduction to Economics is the most digestible, explicable, and humorous 200-page introduction to microeconomics you'll ever read.

Bauman has put the ""comedy"" into ""economy"" at comedy clubs and universities around the country and around the world (his ""Principles of Economics, Translated"" is a YouTube cult classic). As an educator at both the university and high school levels, he has learned how to make economics relevant to today's world and today's students. As Google's chief economist, Hal Varian, wrote, ""You don't need a brand-new economics. You just need to see the really cool stuff, the material they didn't get to when you studied economics."" The Cartoon Introduction to Economics is all about integrating the really cool stuff into an overview of the entire discipline of microeconomics, from decision trees to game trees to taxes and thinking at the margin.

Rendering the cool stuff fun is the artistry of the illustrator and lauded graphic novelist Klein. Panel by panel, page by page, he puts comics into economics. So if the vertiginous economy or a dour professor's 600-page econ textbook has you desperate for a fun, factual guide to economics, reach for The Cartoon Introduction to Economics and let the collaborative genius of the Klein-Bauman team walk you through an entire introductory microeconomics course."

Are you sacrificing your family, friendships, and freedom to keep your business alive? What if instead your business could run itself, freeing you to do what you love when you want, while it continues to grow and turn a profit? 

It’s possible. And it's easier than you think.

If you're like most entrepreneurs, you started your business so you could be your own boss, make the money you deserve, and live life on your own terms. In reality, you're bogged down in the daily grind, constantly putting out fires, answering an endless stream of questions, and continually hunting for cash.

Now, Mike Michalowicz, the author of Profit First and other small-business bestsellers, offers a straightforward step-by-step path out of this dilemma. In Clockwork, he draws on more than six years of research and real life examples to explain his simple approach to making your business ultra-efficient.
Among other powerful strategies, you will discover how to:

  •  Make your employees act like owners: Free yourself from micromanaging by using a simple technique to empower your people to make smart decisions without you.
 
  •  Pinpoint your business's most important function: Unleash incredible efficiency by identifying and focusing everyone on the one function that is most crucial to your business.
 
  •  Know what to fix next: Most entrepreneurs try to fix every inefficiency at once and end up fixing nothing. Use the ""weakest link in the chain"" method to find the one fix that will add the most value now.

Whether you have a staff of one, one hundred, or somewhere in between, whether you're a new entrepreneur or have been overworked and overstressed for years, Clockwork is your path to finally making your business work for you."

The Sovereign Individual details strategies necessary for adapting financially to the next phase of Western civilization.

Few observers of the late twentieth century have their fingers so presciently on the pulse of the global political and economic realignment ushering in the new millennium as do James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg. Their bold prediction of disaster on Wall Street in Blood in the Streets was borne out by Black Tuesday. In their ensuing bestsellar, The Great Reckoning, published just weeks before the coup attempt against Gorbachev, they analyzed the pending collapse of the Soviet Union and foretold the civil war in Yugoslavia and other events that have proved to be among the most searing developments of the past few years.

In The Sovereign Individual, Davidson and Rees-Mogg explore the greatest economic and political transition in centuries -- the shift from an industrial to an information-based society. This transition, which they have termed ""the fourth stage of human society,"" will liberate individuals as never before, irrevocably altering the power of government. This outstanding book will replace false hopes and fictions with new understanding and clarified values."

Having a career plan.

Careers don't just happen. Carers are designed, developed and executed.

I have had what most people would call a successful career. I was promoted 10 times in 15 years, grew from an individual contributor to a VP-level executive and was able to work for companies like Microsoft and Google. I consistently increased my salary, gained more responsibility and saw my work make a real impact on the company's bottom line. 

None of these happened by mistake. I planned my career and meticulously followed through in order to achieve my goals, and you can do the same. You don't need to wait for a company, a manager or karma to get the role, the raise or the promotion you want and deserve. You can build the career of your dreams right now!

Most people don't have a career plan. They go to work, they do their 9 to 5 and hope for the best. They hope their manager will notice their hard work, they hope that the company will decide to offer them a raise, they hope they'll get the promotion they have been yearning for just because it's their turn... 

Let me tell you a secret, hope is not the best strategy for growing your career. 

Why settle for maybe or one day when you have the ability to design the career you want right now?

It's the stuff of classic novels: the story of a boy transformed by his father's dream -- and the cost of that dream. Even as Pete Maravich became Pistol Pete -- a basketball icon for baby boomers -- all the Maraviches paid a price. Now acclaimed author Mark Kriegel has brilliantly captured the saga of an American family: its rise, its apparent ruin, and, finally, its redemption. 

 Almost four decades have passed since Maravich entered the national consciousness as basketball's boy wizard. No one had ever played the game like the kid with the floppy socks and shaggy hair. And all these years later, no one else ever has. The idea of Pistol Pete continues to resonate with young people today just as powerfully as it did with their fathers. 

 In averaging 44.2 points a game at Louisiana State University, he established records that will never be broken. But even more enduring than the numbers was the sense of ecstasy and artistry with which he played. With the ball in his hands, Maravich had a singular power to inspire awe, inflict embarrassment, or even tell a joke. 

 But he wasn't merely a mesmerizing showman. He was basketball's answer to Elvis, a white Southerner who sold Middle America on a black man's game. Like Elvis, he paid a terrible price, becoming a prisoner of his own fame. 

 Set largely in the South, Kriegel's Pistol, a tale of obsession and basketball, fathers and sons, merges several archetypal characters. Maravich was a child prodigy, a prodigal son, his father's ransom in a Faustian bargain, and a Great White Hope. But he was also a creature of contradictions: always the outsider but a virtuoso in a team sport, an exuberant showman who wouldn't look you in the eye, a vegetarian boozer, an athlete who lived like a rock star, a suicidal genius saved by Jesus Christ. 

 A renowned biographer -- People magazine called him ""a master"" -- Kriegel renders his subject with a style that is, by turns, heartbreaking, lyrical, and electric. 

 The narrative begins in 1929, the year a missionary gave Pete's father a basketball. Press Maravich had been a neglected child trapped in a hellish industrial town, but the game enabled him to blossom. It also caused him to confuse basketball with salvation. The intensity of Press's obsession initiates a journey across three generations of Maraviches. Pistol Pete, a ballplayer unlike any other, was a product of his father's vanity and vision. But that dream continues to exact a price on Pete's own sons. Now in their twenties -- and fatherless for most of their lives -- they have waged their own struggles with the game and its ghosts. 

 Pistol is an unforgettable biography. By telling one family's history, Kriegel has traced the history of the game and a large slice of the American narrative."

Do you hate chasing up customers because you don’t know what to say? You think you might upset them or embarrass yourself and then lose them to the competition? For some business owners, it’s just a nightmare!

Lots of businesses avoid chasing up overdue invoices, but the truth is, the longer an invoice is outstanding, the more likely it is never to be paid at all – it will become a bad debt. Too many bad debts can lead to the loss of your business (and worse). Fortunately there is a way for all small businesses to get paid on time. It’s easy, proven and needs no special skills.

Jan owned and managed a successful small business for many years. In GET PAID! she demystifies how she got her customers to pay on time just with efficient invoicing and customer service, and she outlines the five simple steps she used:

1. How to set up for collections success.

2. How to feel 100% confident asking for payment.

3. How to minimise problems that cause payment delays – “the insider secret”.

4. Exactly what to say, when and to whom.

5. How to spot RED FLAGS and what to do about them.

Jan’s simple method proves that customers most certainly do, and most certainly will pay on time (and even early) when they are asked for payment politely at the right time."

Casting a skeptical eye on the growth of the welfare state, Hayek examines the challenges to freedom posed by an ever expanding government as well as its corrosive effect on the creation, preservation, and utilization of knowledge. 


In distinction to those who confidently call for the state to play a greater role in society, Hayek puts forward a nuanced argument for prudence. Guided by this quality, he elegantly demonstrates that a free market system in a democratic polity—under the rule of law and with strong constitutional protections of individual rights—represents the best chance for the continuing existence of liberty. 


Striking a balance between skepticism and hope, Hayek’s profound insights remain strikingly vital half a century on. This definitive edition of The Constitution of Liberty will give a new generation the opportunity to learn from Hayek’s enduring wisdom."

However, like any professional camera of this caliber, the F55 is extremely complex and requires leaning a whole new set of tools and complicated workflows.  This book has been written to help F55 owner/operators get started off on the right foot and flatten the learning curve as much as possible.  


In the no-nonsense style for which Doug Jensen is known, he cuts through the clutter of confusing, misunderstood, and undocumented features.  He demystifies the camera and explains each of it’s functions while providing practical, step-by-step instructions for how to use them.  His suggestions and advanced techniques will improve the quality of your footage, streamline your workflow, and make you more productive. No matter how well you think you know the PMW-F55, you will learn things in this guide that you didn't know before — plus the book makes a handy reference anytime you need a quick refresher course. With over 300 pages of detailed information, there isn’t a single important subject not included.


Topics include:  Getting Started, Creating a User Menu, Recording Formats, the Custom Shooting Mode, Paint Menus, Scene Files, the Cine EI Shooting Mode, LUTs & Look Profiles, Setting Exposure, White Balance, Markers, All Files, Memory Card choices, Video Monitoring, 2K Center Scan, Shooting RAW, S&Q Motion, custom Clip Naming, Assign Buttons, Audio Recording, Timecode & Genlock, Picture Cache, Interval Recording, Wi-Fi Control, System Menus, Playback Operation, Updating Firmware, Ingesting & Archiving, and much more."

The two men turn to King Richard II to solve the dilemma, but the king can do little, and the men look to settle with a duel. Moments before the fight begins, Richard stops the duel and banishes the two men.

Prove It! is the executive guide to improving organisational performance through the practice of evidence-based leadership. More than ever before, the world is demanding transparency and accountability from organisational leaders, and there is a growing push to hold leaders responsible for the performance of their organisation. Many executives panic at the thought of what transparency might reveal and how they might be held accountable, but others relish the opportunity to showcase their organisation's performance. The difference is in the leadership methodology. The best leaders already know how their organisation is performing, and that it has improved during their tenure – and they can prove it because they practise evidence-based leadership. This book offers a clear blueprint for building on your existing skills and performance management systems to build a truly high performance organisation. 

Just three personal leadership habits and three organisation-wide habits can transform your organisation into the powerhouse you know it can be. With a simple methodology and a focus on practical results, this book can help you: 
Set a strategic direction that really does inspire organisational excellence Gain a true picture of your organisation's performance Master the habits that help you lead a high-performance culture Improve your organisation objectively, measurably and quickly  
If an organisation can only be as good as its leadership, it's reasonable to place the burden of performance responsibility on those who make the decisions. A leader's job is to inspire, motivate and guide, and those who do it well are already raising the bar. Prove It! gives you a practical model for measurable, real-world results, starting today."

Laura Palmer's character began as a plot device that triggered a small town to face its fractured self. But after three seasons and a film, Laura Palmer is no longer just a plot device. Instead of solely focusing on the murderer, like most traditional storytelling at the time, the audience gets to know the victim, a complex young woman who explores her sexuality and endures incredible abuse. Laura's Ghost: Women Speak About Twin Peaks is an examination of Laura Palmer's legacy on the 30th anniversary of Twin Peaks. Palmer's character was one of the few frank and horrific representations of sexual abuse victims which did not diminish the strength and complexity of the victim. Sheryl Lee, who played Laura Palmer, discusses the challenges of the role and how it has impacted herself as well as women she has met over the years, many of whom are survivors of sexual abuse. The role demanded Lee give all of her vulnerability as an actor to this role. This role is one she cannot escape, one with which she will forever be identified. It's a role that still haunts her today. For many women, this character represents them. Here was a woman who was not just a victim, but who was owning her sexuality as well—a woman coming into her own and discovering her sources of power. This book is a reckoning in which women from the show and community speak about grief, mischief, humor, sexuality, strength, weakness, wickedness, and survival."

In 2014, Elizabeth and Nate Thames were conventional 9-5 young urban professionals. But the couple had a dream to become modern-day homesteaders in rural Vermont. Determined to retire as early as possible in order to start living each day—as opposed to wishing time away working for the weekends—they enacted a plan to save an enormous amount of money: well over seventy percent of their joint take home pay. Dubbing themselves the Frugalwoods, Elizabeth began documenting their unconventional frugality and the resulting wholesale lifestyle transformation on their eponymous blog.

In less than three years, Elizabeth and Nate reached their goal. Today, they are financially independent and living out their dream on a sixty-six-acre homestead in the woods of rural Vermont with their young daughter. While frugality makes their lifestyle possible, it’s also what brings them peace and genuine happiness. They don’t stress out about impressing people with their material possessions, buying the latest gadgets, or keeping up with any Joneses. In the process, Elizabeth discovered the self-confidence and liberation that stems from disavowing our culture’s promise that we can buy our way to ""the good life."" Elizabeth unlocked the freedom of a life no longer beholden to the clarion call to consume ever-more products at ever-higher sums.

Meet the Frugalwoods is the intriguing story of how Elizabeth and Nate realized that the mainstream path wasn’t for them, crafted a lifestyle of sustainable frugality, and reached financial independence at age thirty-two. While not everyone wants to live in the woods, or quit their jobs, many of us want to have more control over our time and money and lead more meaningful, simplified lives. Following their advice, you too can live your best life."

It is a Technical Analysis approach based on the study of supply and demand; that is, on the continuous interaction between buyers and sellers.

The approach is simple: when well-informed traders want to buy or sell, they carry out processes that leave their traces on the chart through price and volume.

The Wyckoff Methodology tries to identify that professional intervention to try to elucidate who is most likely to be in control of the market and enable us to pose judicious scenarios of where the price is most likely to go.


Why should you study this methodology, and why this book?

▶ Unique theoretical conceptual framework

This is the cornerstone of the methodology, which makes it stand above any other form of technical analysis; and that is because it is the only one that informs us about what is really happening in the market in a logical manner.

This approach is based on a real underlying logic through its 3 fundamental laws:

1. Law of Supply and Demand. It is the true engine of the market. You will learn to analyze the traces left by the interactions between the major traders.
2. Law of Cause and Effect. The idea is that something cannot happen out of the blue; that for the price to develop a trend movement (effect) it must first have built a cause previously.
3. Law of Effort and Result. It is about analyzing price and volume in comparative terms to conclude whether the market actions denote harmony or divergence.

It is a universal analysis approach, where its reading is applicable to any financial market and over any time frame.
It is recommended to analyze centralized markets such as stocks and futures where volume is genuine and representative; as well as assets with sufficient liquidity in order to avoid possible manipulation maneuvers.

▶ Price and volume analytical tools
We will understand that markets do not move in a straight line but in waves of varying degrees, which create trends and ranges.

We will learn to also assess the health of the trend with the most useful analyses of price action (velocity, projection, depth) and gain much more valuable insight into the use of trend lines.

▶  It provides context and roadmap
Thanks to the accumulation and distribution schemes we will be able to identify the professional's participation as well as the general market sentiment up to the present moment, enabling us to pose truly objective scenarios.

The Events and Phases are unique elements of the methodology and help us to guide the development of the structures. This puts us in a position of what to expect the price to do following the occurrence of each of them, giving us a roadmap to follow at all times.

▶  It determines high probability trading zones
The Methodology provides us with the exact zones on which we will act, as well as examples of triggers to enter the market, making it as easy as possible to know where to look for trades.

In addition, the book includes a section on position management where different configurations for setting stop losses and taking targets are discussed.


Finally, we include a section of case studies where we analyze real market examples in different assets and time frames.
I sincerely hope you enjoy it and find it valuable."

If that sounds great to you, then it’s time to start centering on retiring while you’re young, healthy, and motivated to take full advantage of what early retirement has to provide.


Most individuals believe they need to be wealthy to retire young. They don’t. Many individuals have retired in their 40s or 50s without being rich; but neither were they poor. The net worth you’re going to need will depend upon the lifestyle you wish to live.


And the philosophy is quite easy: if you are able to live on less than most individuals, you are able to likely retire earlier than most individuals. If you wish to retire young, spend less, save more, and invest wisely.

What is econobabble? We hear it every day, when politicians and commentators use incomprehensible economic jargon to dress up their self-interest as the national interest, to make the absurd seem inevitable or the inequitable seem fair. This book exposes the stupid arguments, bizarre contradictions and complete lack of evidence upon which much ‘common sense’ about the economy rests in Australia.



Econobabble is for those who, deep down, have never believed that it makes sense, economic or otherwise, to help poor people by slashing public spending on the services they need. It’s for those who have a sneaking suspicion that it would be cheaper to avoid the effects of climate change than to let them happen and then ‘adapt’. And it’s for those who think pitting public health and aged care against the economy is a false dilemma, one that’s short-sighted, callous and potentially dangerous.



In this new edition, Richard Denniss demolishes the tired and misleading arguments of right-wing economic ‘experts’ with humour and precision, empowering you to cut through the babble and reach the truth.



‘The best guide you’ll find to the literal non-sense that usually passes for economic debate in this country.’ —Ross Gittins"

Is comedy was based not on actors performing sketch material, but on the personalities and experiences of real people, drawing on their normal lives and occupations. The program's distinction and quality, however, resulted primarily from its giving Groucho Marx an opportunity to exercise his unique skills without the restraints that broadcasting at that time otherwise imposed. Groucho's principal resource was his talent as an improvisor of verbal comedy. Dwan will keep the reader giggling with his stories about You Bet Your Life."

Many end up using a pricing model that leaves them run ragged trying to pay the bills, rather than one that lets them build a healthy, sustainable business.

If you’re quoting clients an hourly rate for your services, chances are you’re hurting your business… even if that hourly rate was methodically calculated. That’s because you can really only charge so much per hour and there are only so many hours in a week, putting a limit on how much you can earn. Problem is—that limit usually has nothing to do with how valuable your services are.

There’s a better way to approach your pricing and building your business, a way that’s fair to both you and your clients. In this book you’ll learn how to significantly increase your income by charging what you’re really worth. You’ll discover that value-based pricing is not about putting a bigger price tag on your work. It’s about fundamentally changing the way you work with your clients, a way that opens the door to bigger and better results for the both of you.

This incredibly simple book that you can read in just one hour, will show you how to be rewarded for all your skills, talents, wisdom and creativity."

On this occasion, he gained the third prize in the tragic contests, but the first, fourteen years after, and subsequently, with the “Hippolytus,” in 428 B.C. The peculiar tendency of some of the ideas expressed in his plays, was the probable cause of the retirement of Euripides to Macedonia, where he obtained the friendship of King Archelaus. Perhaps, however, the unhappiness of his connubial state, arising from the infidelity of his two wives, might have rendered Athens a disagreeable place of abode for the woman-hating poet, especially when his “domestic bliss” was continually seasoned by the sarcastic jokes and allusions of his political enemy, Aristophanes. Moreover, his acquaintance with the talking philosopher, Socrates, must have been unfavorable to the continuance of his popularity."

Through reflection over the economics at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution the book touches upon such broad topics as the division of labour, productivity and free markets. The Wealth of Nations is a clearly written account of economics at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. The book was a landmark work in the history and economics as it was comprehensive and an accurate characterization of the economic mechanisms at work in modern economics.

It is radically altering the formation and functioning of business and society. This strategic management book analyses the impact Peoplism has on organizational success. It outlines the challenges facing business leaders in adjusting to the demands of a marketplace where commoditization and globalization continually erode margins.


Coined by Alec Reed, the term Peoplism describes an economic state where individuals own and control the most important factor of production, their human ability. After centuries where money and capital have been the driving force of business and the economy, Reed argues that the importance has shifted irreversibly towards the individual. And whilst companies confidently declare that people are their most important asset, the real consequences of such statements have yet to bite.


Based on original research, Capitalism is Dead: Peoplism Rules examines and proffers practical solutions to the key challenges which lie at the core of today's business. They include:


- the diminishing power of the state - organizational implications and opportunities

- recruitment, retention and measurement of top talent - optimizing private intellect insurance

- the diminishing power of the brand - how to reposition marketing when it is off-target

- short-termism and narrow focus of accounting practices - how to realign with the key value drivers

- how to develop Unique Strategic Positioning within companies, strategies for boosting the corporate libido, and proposals for developing the new Profit:Enterprise ratios.


Written with the warning that Peoplism is no kinder than capitalism, this book explains why companies need to act on this radical sea change, and advises how best to do so."

Because, let's face it, publishing a book is a lot of work. Hours of time spent researching, writing, editing all to get your book out there ready to be sold. But the process can't end there.

You have to be able to market your book to both your current readers, as well as new ones.

I've talked to dozens of self published book authors who are fantastic writers and have a really hard time getting the sales and readers their book deserves. 

Authors who don't even have email lists, or even if they do, don't know how to reach out to their subscribers and build up those relationships. Authors who start off with a bang and then after only a month just see a trickle of sales. Authors who feel their book must be a failure because they just can't get it to sell.

 When beloved host Johnny Carson announced his retirement after thirty years on The Tonight Show, millions of Americans mourned. But inside the television industry, the news ignited a battle between two amazing talents—Jay Leno and David Letterman—who both yearned to occupy the departing legend’s chair. For NBC, it would be a decision with millions of dollars at stake. Soon these two comedians with strikingly different styles, who had once shared a friendship as they worked the clubs together, would be engaged in a fierce competition for the prize.
  
 Based on in-depth reporting and interviews with those involved, and updated with a new introduction by the author—a producer of CNN series The Story of Late Night—The Late Shift is a “vivid, behind-the-scenes, blow-by-blow account” of the fight that ensued, as stars, agents, and executives maneuvered for control of the most profitable program in TV history (Chicago Tribune).
  
 “Remarkably gripping . . . Takes us deep into the bizarre high-stakes world of broadcasting . . . A powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners.” —The New York Times Book Review

In this honest, frank analysis, Paul and Brendan Moynihan revisit the events that led to Paul's disastrous decision and examine the psychological factors behind bad financial practices in several economic sectors.


This book -- winner of a 2014 Axiom Business Book award gold medal -- begins with the unbroken string of successes that helped Paul achieve a jet-setting lifestyle and land a key spot with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It then describes the circumstances leading up to Paul's $1.6 million loss and the essential lessons he learned from it -- primarily that, although there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people participating in them, all losses come from the same few sources.


Investors lose money in the markets either because of errors in their analysis or because of psychological barriers preventing the application of analysis. While all analytical methods have some validity and make allowances for instances in which they do not work, psychological factors can keep an investor in a losing position, causing him to abandon one method for another in order to rationalize the decisions already made. Paul and Moynihan's cautionary tale includes strategies for avoiding loss tied to a simple framework for understanding, accepting, and dodging the dangers of investing, trading, and speculating."

誰とでも仲良くなれる「共感」コミュニケーション術がズバリわかる! 


「うちの部下はどうして指示通り仕事をしてくれないんだろう」 


「子供たちがちっとも親のいうことを聞いてくれない」 


「恋人は私の気持ちが全然わかっていない」 


あなたはこんな悩みを抱えていませんか? 

これらの「相手とのコミュニケーションの問題」は人類が誕生してから、ずっと人々を苦しめてきました。 


私も、会社員時代に「どうして後輩は私の言うことを聞いてくれないんだろう」と、悩み続けていたものです。 

そこで、多くの書籍を読み漁り、人間の心理や感情について研究しました。 


そして、一つの結論にたどり着きました。 


「言うことを聞かないのは脳みそのせいだから、気にすることはない。 

それよりも脳に聞かせるためのメソッドを実行して、共感力を引き出すべきだ」と。 


私がこのメソッドを編み出してから、これまで思い通りに動かなかった後輩たちは、 

気持ちよく私の指示に従うようになり、家族や友人との関係も非常に良好なものになりました。 


この方法は、決してマインドコントロールのような 

怪しいものではありませんし、難しいテクニックも必要ありません。 


「ただ知るだけ」で、すぐに誰でも実行できる簡単な方法です。 


人間関係に悩んでいるあなた、相手が思い通りに動いてくれなくて 

苦しんでいるあなたにとって、非常に力強い味方になってくれるはずです。

‘Unconditional Love is a shining example of the strength of mothers. Jocelyn’s sensitivity and humour made me fall in love with her passion for filmmaking and her family. Her resilience is inspiring and beautiful.’ Nicole Kidman

‘A truly wonderful book, a heartfelt achievement. I read it over two days, unable to put it down.’ Jane Campion 

‘A beguiling memoir, written from the heart, revealing a life lived truly.’ Cate Blanchett 

I want to write about being a mother, and about raising four extraordinary kids. Being their parent is like having an intense love affair with four people at the same time. And I want to write about making movies and writing screenplays. I come from a long line of storytellers.

Jocelyn Moorhouse grew up with adoring parents and siblings. She knew early on that she wanted to be a filmmaker, and her dreams were encouraged by her family and by her teachers.

Meeting P.J. Hogan, becoming parents and filmmakers together, was a turning point. But when they discovered that two of their children were autistic, Jocelyn’s life turned upside down. In Unconditional Love, she writes with humour and intelligence about her fears and hopes for her children, the highs and lows in her international career, about Hollywood and home, and about her love for what she does best – filmmaking and motherhood.

Jocelyn Moorhouse, award-winning screenplay writer and film director, was born in Melbourne in 1960. She has directed numerous films, including Proof, How to Make an American Quilt, A Thousand Acres and The Dressmaker. She has produced some of her husband P.J. Hogan’s films, including Muriel’s Wedding and Mental. They have four children, two of whom are autistic.

‘[A]n inspirational read...Moorhouse and Hogan’s lives are testament to the imperative sacrifices of parenthood...Stories like [these] are crucial to our understanding of what being a mother means in our modern society.' Readings Monthly

‘Through deeply personal ruminations about herself and her family, the director makes the point that being a great artist is never as important as being a good human being.’ Guardian

	‘[Jocelyn] lays bare her soul … she writes frankly about the challenges associated with being a mum and a career woman. ... It's a heartfelt account you'll want to finish in one sitting.’ Age"

This book belongs to the Maritime Business and Economic History strand of the Palgrave Studies in Maritime Economics book series.

This volume highlights the contribution of the shipping industry to the transformations in business and society of the postwar era. Shipping was both an example and an engine of globalization and structural change. In turn, the industry experienced and pioneered, mirrored and enabled key developments that led to the present-day globalized economy. Contributions address issues such as the macro-level shift of shipping’s centre of gravity from Europe to Asia, the political and legal frameworks within which it developed, the strategies and performance of both successful and unsuccessful firms, and the links between the shipping industry and the wider economy and society. Without shipping and its ability to forge connections and networks of a global reach, the modern world would look very different.

By bringing together scholars from various disciplinary and national backgrounds, this book advances our understanding of the linkages that bind economies and societies together."

In The Dao of Capital, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging pioneer Mark Spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis, as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping, circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. We arrive at his central investment methodology of Austrian Investing, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle, but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new intertemporal dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring.

Spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and—as Spitznagel has shown—highly effective investment methodology. From identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel “brings Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio.”

The Dao of Capital provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today."

Entrepreneur Nigel Collin interviewed over 80 successful Australian entrepreneurs and leaders to learn the key factors that make a successful business; in this book, he distils his findings into a simple process of four actions governed by three behaviours that will guide your path to the top. Examples and case studies eschew the limelight in favour of those on the front lines of business doing well, illustrating the revolutionary idea that you don't have to make headlines to be a success. By shifting your mindset from explosive, overnight success to a quieter, more consistent, more sustainable process, you gain the ability to reach the top and stay there. You'll discover that innovation is actually in reach, doesn't cost too much and is not really all that complex when approached from a growth-oriented mindset of making small changes consistently.

You don't need to be Steve Jobs, and you don't need to create the next iPhone to be a success in business. What you do need to do is redirect your attention away from who you are and toward what you deliver.
  Learn what really drives sustainable success Discover innovation that's within reach right now Focus on what you do, not who you are Work toward a process of constant, consistent improvement  
Business success is not a one-off event or a single ""eureka"" moment. It's a continuous, step-by-step process of becoming better every day. Incremental change is the surest route to the top; though others may skip the climb in favour of a helicopter, those who earn the summit tend to stay longest.

That's the weird thing about it.""

 —Bob Dylan


""Pioneers are often written out of history but never let it be forgotten that Scaduto was the man. It's scandalous that this book has been out of print for so many years. Its return (Kindle) should be greeted with dancing in the street.""

—Jimmy Rogan, composer


He was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota. 

He surfaced in Greenwich Village nearly twenty years later with a new name and a reinvented personality. He went on to become the most influential-and elusive-culture hero of our time. This is the first full story of Bob Dylan. It ‘s based on interviews with people like Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Dave Van Ronk.  Lovers and haters. Apostles and apostates. Plus reminiscences from Dylan himself.  It's all here. The good. The bad.  And the gritty. 


Written at the dawn of the seventies by reporter Anthony Scaduto this book was the first serious study of Dylan's life and work. By applying the rigorous standards of research and analysis it elevated popular music journalism to a respected discipline.


In addition to a Bob biographer's wish-list of interviews, Scaduto pulled the remarkable coup of getting Dylan's full co-operation without conceding an editorial veto. Dylan has read this book cover to cover and discusses its uncomfortable contents with the author at length!


Includes an exclusive interview between Anthony Scaduto and Bob Dylan and a Postscript written by Scaduto in 2008.


...""In the beginning was Scaduto,"" wrote Clinton Heylin at the start of own Dylan bioography. We'll never know the whole story of Minnesota's most noted mouth organist but Anthony Scaduto's 1971 book was the pioneering protrait of this legendarily elusive artist. Now, in a welcome reprint it's a real treat to read the still-classic Bobography, methodical and lean, Scaduto's style reflected his background as a New York crime reporter, with a ""just the facts, ma'am"" technique that built the right tension...

Shakespeare’s romantic tragedy has inspired musicals, ballets, operas, and, of course, countless movies, including Italian director Franco Zeffirelli’s 1968 classic and Australian director Baz Luhrmann’s stylish remake starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The Bard’s play is so fundamental to our culture-and to the popular trope of star-crossed lovers-that we all feel like we know the story of Romeo and Juliet’s doomed love affair.


And yet, have you ever read the original? And if yes, perchance was it a long, long time ago? The beautiful lyricism of Shakespeare’s storytelling makes poring over his words such a complex treat:

What light in yonder window breaks?

Parting is such sweet sorrow.

Learn what balance REALLY is and how to work from home with little ones while still honoring your grown-up self and her dreams and goals. Life is not filled with either-or choices, but rather, is full of this AND that.

Learn how to become a quitter, and why that can be the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself and for your family. You’ll learn to have more by doing less.

Find out why working moms rock, and why self-employment is the absolute best way for mamas to pursue their passion. Learn how the skills you already have are in great demand, and how to turn them into a successful business that produces a steady, predictable source of income.

Lauren, a master at focus and time management, shows you how to set up systems and use the time you have in the best possible way. She shares her “Daily 5” approach to rocking each day’s tasks and teaches you how to set boundaries in your work and personal lives so that each gets your full attention.

Maybe before. Exponentially improving technologies such as solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous (self-driving) cars will disrupt and sweep away the energy and transportation industries as we know it. The same Silicon Valley ecosystem that created bit-based technologies that have disrupted atom-based industries is now creating bit- and electron-based technologies that will disrupt atom-based energy industries. 


Clean Disruption projections (based on technology cost curves, business model innovation as well as product innovation) show that by 2030:

-    All new energy will be provided by solar or wind.

-    All new mass-market vehicles will be electric.

-    All of these vehicles will be autonomous (self-driving) or semi-autonomous.

-    The new car market will shrink by 80%.

-    Even if EVs don't kill the gasoline car by 2030, the self-driving car will shrink gasoline consumption by up to 80%.

-    Gasoline will be obsolete. Nuclear is already obsolete.

-    Up to 80% of highways will be redundant.

-    Up to 80% of parking spaces will be redundant.

-    The concept of individual car ownership will be obsolete.

-    The Car Insurance industry will be disrupted.


The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of rocks. It ended because a disruptive technology ushered in the Bronze Age. The era of centralized, command-and-control, extraction-resource-based energy sources (oil, gas, coal and nuclear) will not end because we run out of petroleum, natural gas, coal, or uranium. It will end because these energy sources, the business models they employ, and the products that sustain them will be disrupted by superior technologies, product architectures, and business models.  


This is a technology-based disruption reminiscent of how the cell phone, Internet, and personal computer swept away industries such as landline telephony, publishing, and mainframe computers. Just like those technology disruptions flipped the architecture of information and brought abundant, cheap and participatory information, the clean disruption will flip the architecture of energy and bring abundant, cheap and participatory energy. Just like those previous technology disruptions, the clean disruption is inevitable and it will be swift."

 Apple cofounder Steve Jobs (1955-2011) had such an enormous impact on so many people that his life often took on aspects of myth. But much of his success was due to collaboration with designers, engineers and thinkers. The Zen of Steve Jobs tells the story of Jobs' relationship with one such person: Kobun Chino Otogawa.

 Kobun was a Zen Buddhist priest who emigrated to the U.S. from Japan in the early 1970s. He was an innovator, lacked appreciation for rules and was passionate about art and design. Kobun was to Buddhism as Jobs was to the computer business: a renegade and maverick. It wasn't long before the two became friends--a relationship that was not built to last.

 This graphic book is a reimagining of that friendship. The story moves back and forward in time, from the 1970s to 2011, but centers on the period after Jobs' exile from Apple in 1985 when he took up intensive study with Kobun. Their time together was integral to the big leaps that Apple took later on with its product design and business strategy.

 Told using stripped down dialogue and bold calligraphic panels, The Zen of Steve Jobs explores how Jobs might have honed his design aesthetic via Eastern religion before choosing to identify only what he needs and leave the rest behind."

But, actually, this isn't the case at all. In fact, these super-rich individuals realize that their money needs to work for them and so they learn how to take what are known as ""calculated"" risks.

The super-rich are definitely not psychics, nor do they have a ""magic"" secret that they hold close to their own kind. In fact, their real secret lies in the fact that they know what simple investing mistakes should be avoided. And, in truth, these mistakes are common knowledge, even among those investors who are not particularly wealthy at all.

Investing properly is a guided, purposeful tool for building and adding to wealth, but it is not only for the rich. Actually, anyone can get started quite easily, and there are multiple avenues that make it easy to begin, with small amounts to start up a portfolio. Additionally, what differentiates using investment (as opposed to gambling) is that it takes a period of time for the ""magic"" to happen. Therefore, it is not a get-rich-quick scheme, at all. I want us to be clear on that point from the get-go.

By the end of this book, you'll have a great understanding of what investing is, and you will know how the magic of compounding works too. We'll take a look at other options that you might find useful, so then you'll have the knowledge you need before you get started with your own investing. Again, thank you for joining me here; it's my pleasure to guide you through this important information. I believe that knowledge is power, and I hope that you'll feel more comfortable once you get the real gist of how it all works, and how it can work really well for you."

In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter's sacrifice to Achilles. Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

Whether as a daydream or a spoken desire, nearly all of us have entertained the notion of reinventing ourselves. Feeling unfulfilled, burned out, or just plain unhappy with what we’re doing, we long to make that leap into the unknown. But we also hold on, white-knuckled, to the years of time and effort we’ve invested in our current profession.

In this powerful book, Herminia Ibarra presents a new model for career reinvention that flies in the face of everything we’ve learned from ""career experts."" While common wisdom holds that we must first know what we want to do before we can act, Ibarra argues that this advice is backward. Knowing, she says, is the result of doing and experimenting. Career transition is not a straight path toward some predetermined identity, but a crooked journey along which we try on a host of ""possible selves"" we might become.

Based on her in-depth research on professionals and managers in transition, Ibarra outlines an active process of career reinvention that leverages three ways of ""working identity"": experimenting with new professional activities, interacting in new networks of people, and making sense of what is happening to us in light of emerging possibilities.

Through engrossing stories—from a literature professor turned stockbroker to an investment banker turned novelist—Ibarra reveals a set of guidelines that all successful reinventions share. She explores specific ways that hopeful career changers of any background can:

Explore possible selves
Craft and execute ""identity experiments""
Create ""small wins"" that keep momentum going
Survive the rocky period between career identities
Connect with role models and mentors who can ease the transition
Make time for reflection—without missing out on windows of opportunity
Decide when to abandon the old path in order to follow the new
Arrange new events into a coherent story of who we are becoming.

A call to the dreamer in each of us, Working Identity explores the process for crafting a more fulfilling future. Where we end up may surprise us."

Yhome and Rajeev Ranjan Chaturvedy

Asia’s rise on the global economic map has necessitated greater interconnection within, and with, the outside world. This development of interconnection is taking place between nations as well as across regions and sub-regions in Asia. The concept ‘economic corridor’ is used to explain this phenomenon. Economic corridors link economic agents within a country or across regions by providing connection between economic nodes or hubs where economic resources and actors are concentrated. Economic corridors are seen as a “catalyst for regional integration” and a “driver for inclusive growth” by bringing in lagging regions into the growth process. They also provide “spatial focus” for regional cooperation initiatives by facilitating priorities of regional projects as well as access to global production chains. The basic emphasis that lies in the creation of economic corridors is to ensure that within a contiguous area, there is potential to attract investments and generate economic activity.

The volume looks at four specific proposed and/or planned projects of trans-regional economic corridors connecting South Asia and Southeast Asia, and through them to other regions. The proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor will connect the Indian and the Pacific Oceans through South and Southeast Asian littorals. China’s Maritime Silk Road initiative plans to link East Asia to Africa and Europe through South and Southeast Asia. The four-nation Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar Economic Corridor plans to connect China’s southwest region to India’s eastern region through Bangladesh and Myanmar. Lastly, the Trans-Himalayan Economic Corridor will link South and Southeast Asia to Central Asia through Nepal. While economic corridors are of course judged on their economic merit, there are also strategic and security issues associated with these corridors, as is evident from the papers in this volume.

From that first printing of that first book came a series unlike anything in the publishing world, one that is global in both geography - we have been published worldwide in some 30 languages - and in coverage. No single volume can hope to summarize what thousands of titles have meant to millions of readers over the years, and we don't claim to do that in this e-book. Rather, this e-book celebrates the breadth and depth of the For Dummies series, offering 20 chapters - in honor of our 20 years - from a list of books compiled by our global colleagues. We are confident the chapters we've included give you a representative glimpse at why - no matter what the topic - our products have meant so much to so many by Making Everything Easier. We've grouped our chapters into five main parts:
Part I: Dummies Classics, offers four chapters from some of our best-loved books. There's a chapter from DOS For Dummies, the book that started it all, and chapters from two of our best-sellers: Windows 7 For Dummies and Sex For Dummies. And just for a bit of spice, we've included a chapter from French For Dummies.

Part II: Daily Dose of Dummies, offers the kind of lifestyle, self-help, and business skills that our readers have come to treasure. There's one of our famous Part of Tens chapters from Cognititive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies and a chapter from Meditation For Dummies to help you get your center. Chapters from Leadership For Dummies and Marketing For Dummies help you develop new skills for the marketplace.

Part III, Fun with Dummies, celebrates life and all it has to offer. We've got chapters here from The Royal Wedding For Dummies, Guitar For Dummies, Digital Photography SLR All-in-One For Dummies, Puppies for Dummies, Knitting For Dummies, and Wine For Dummies.

Part IV, Get Social, highlights how we help you grow and develop new skills. Chapters here come from Facebook For Dummies, Social Media Marketing For Dummies, and Dating For Dummies.

Part V, Going Global, shares the worldwide appeal of the For Dummies series. These chapters from British History For Dummies, Canadian History For Dummies, and Rugby Union For Dummies were created by our global colleagues and authors and show how the For Dummies approach applies not only to whatever the subject is at hand, but also wherever the discussion is taking place.

Without it, many people fail to develop their true leadership potential and miss out on genuine fulfillment in their lives and their relationships. Humilitas: A Lost Key to Life, Love, and Leadership shows how the virtue of humility can turn your strengths into true greatness in all areas of life. Through the lessons of history, business, and the social sciences, author John Dickson shows that humility is not low self-esteem, groveling, or losing our distinct gifts. Instead, humility both recognizes our inherent worth and seeks to use whatever power we have at our disposal on behalf of others. Some of the world’s most inspiring and influential players have been people of immense humility. The more we learn about humility, the more we understand how essential it is to a satisfying career and personal life. By embracing this virtue, we will transform for good the unique contributions we each make to the world."

Menger, William Stanley Jevons, and Léon Walras are considered the co-founders of the “marginal revolution” in economics, a shift to the marginal utility theory of value from the labour theory of value. The revolutionists argued that value is not based on the amount of labour expended but reflects how useful people perceive the commodity to be in satisfying their ends."

This combustible blend of creative brilliance produced some of the most acclaimed, audacious, and  innovative programming of the eighties, including a black and white tribute to film noir, with an introduction by Orson Welles; a parody of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, written in iambic pentameter; an homage to The Honeymooners; and countless metafictive episodes breaking through the fourth wall — almost unheard of at the time for hourlong comedy-dramas. Without a doubt, Moonlighting helped pave the way for the era of prestige television we are now all enjoying.  The real story of this pioneering television series and the extraordinary behind-the-scenes challenges, battles, and rewards has never been told  — until now, Author Scott Ryan (The Last Days of Letterman, thirtysomething at thirty: an oral history, The Blue Rose, Scott Luck Stories) conducted over twenty interviews with the actors, writers, directors, and producers who made Moonlighting such a dynamic, unforgettable show, delving deep into their thoughts and feelings as they relive this magical moment in pop culture history in this full color oral history.

An ode to live theater and the resilience of The Simpsons, Anne Washburn's apocalyptic comedy Mr. Burns—""even better than its hype"" (New York Post)—is an imaginative exploration of how the culture of one generation can evolve into the mythology of the next. Following an enthusiastic critical reception from New York critics for its world premiere, Mr. Burns will receive its London premiere in spring 2014. Also included in the collection are The Small, I Have Loved Strangers, and Orestes, all of which, together, develop a theme of destruction, from the personal to the city to civilization and, finally, to the destruction of form.

Anne Washburn's plays include The Internationalist, A Devil at Noon, Apparition, The Communist Dracula Pageant, I Have Loved Strangers, The Ladies, The Small, and a transadaptation of Euripides's Orestes. Her awards include a Guggenheim, NYFA Fellowship, Time Warner Fellowship, and a Susan Smith Blackburn finalist. She is a member of 13P, The Civilians, and is a New Georges affiliated artist."

The 3D value investing strategy exists to help investors achieve superior returns on long-term investments, reduce risk through better selection of stocks and diversification, understand what a share price should be and when to buy in and sell out. Using the techniques, principles and dimensions detailed in this book, we are achieving at least 20% returns p.a. consistently and you can too. All by yourself.

We are independent investors. When we set out, like so many others, we worked with investment managers. But we grew frustrated when our returns were not as great as we'd hoped. So we decided to do it ourselves.

For six years, we devised, experimented, revised and refined our investment strategy. Applying three clear dimensions to our investments proved key to our best successes. Those dimensions were fundamental analysis, valuation and timing. 3D value investing was born.

This is a long-term investment strategy that ignores all market media buzz, trends and fashions, looking only at hard financial facts. Developed from seeds sown originally by the value investing pioneers, Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, we have created and streamlined a series of very specific processes. When these are applied to reported financial information from listed businesses around the world we see deeply into those businesses, get a clear view of their strengths and weaknesses and determine their fair value. We've also developed a technique to forecast the best time to buy in and sell out.

In order to apply our 3D value investing processes to 40,000+ businesses worldwide we built an online tool called STRIDE. Using this platform we are now investing in businesses across every major stock market in the world, reducing our risk through extreme diversification by investing in multiple geographies, currencies and sectors.

We were certain we could devise a strategy that would make us better returns independently than we ever saw with an investment manager. And we were right."

Indeed, the financial crisis that crested in 2008 destroyed the credibility of the economic thinking that had guided policymakers for a generation. But what will take its place?

In How the Economy Works, one of our leading economists provides a jargon-free exploration of the current crisis, offering a powerful argument for how economics must change to get us out of it. Roger E. A. Farmer traces the swings between classical and Keynesian economics since the early twentieth century, gracefully explaining the elements of both theories. During the Great Depression, Keynes challenged the longstanding idea that an economy was a self-correcting mechanism; but his school gave way to a resurgence of classical economics in the 1970s-a rise that ended with the current crisis. Rather than simply allowing the pendulum to swing back, Farmer writes, we must synthesize the two. From classical economics, he takes the idea that a sound theory must explain how individuals behave-how our collective choices shape the economy. From Keynesian economics, he adopts the principle that markets do not always work well, that capitalism needs some guidance. The goal, he writes, is to correct the excesses of a free-market economy without stifling entrepreneurship and instituting central planning.

Recent events have shown that we cannot afford to treat economics as an ivory-tower abstraction. It has a direct impact on our lives by guiding regulators and policymakers as they make decisions with far-reaching practical consequences. Written in clear, accessible language, How the Economy Works makes an argument that no one should ignore."

This book presents methods to evaluate sustainable development using economic tools. The focus on sustainable development takes the reader beyond economic growth to encompass inclusion, environmental stewardship and good governance.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for outcomes. In illustrating the SDGs, the book employs three evaluation approaches: impact evaluation, cost-benefit analysis and objectives-based evaluation. The innovation lies in connecting evaluation tools with economics. Inclusion, environmental care and good governance, thought of as “wicked problems”, are given centre stage. The book uses case studies to show the application of evaluation tools. It offers guidance to evaluation practitioners, students of development and policymakers. The basic message is that evaluation comes to life when its links with socio-economic, environmental, and governance policies are capitalized on.

Since premiering in 2009, the groundbreaking television sitcom Modern Family has garnered tens of millions of devoted fans, earning 75 Emmy nominations and 22 Emmy Awards, including five in a row for Outstanding Comedy Series (one of only two sitcoms to ever achieve that feat). Professors have written about it. Psychologists have lectured on it. Leading publications, such as The New York Times and Washington Post, have explained their love for it. With funny, heartfelt and relatable stories about family, Modern Family has gained a worldwide following of hundreds of millions of viewers in countries as diverse as England, Israel, The Netherlands, Germany, and South Africa.

As much as people love the show, few know the stories behind it. How did a kernel of an idea by Emmy-winning writers Steve Levitan and Chris Lloyd morph into a television juggernaut? Where did they find the cast? How did they come up with story ideas and film favorite episodes? What went on behind the scenes? Up until now, there have been individual stories and interviews about the show, but nothing comprehensive that captures the complete story of the series.

Marc Freeman's Modern Family: The Untold Oral History of One of Television's Groundbreaking Sitcoms is the only major book ever written that explores this show as told by those who created it. More than seventy people, including the entire cast, crew, and creators, detail the full history of this iconic sitcom. The cast recalls their memories of the trials and tribulations of casting. They share their impressions from the first table read through the last light turning out. Writers, directors, and performers walk readers through storylines, production and favorite episodes. Guest stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Josh Gad, Adam Devine, Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane recall their appearances on the show while others recount their experiences working with Kevin Hart, Barbara Streisand, Ed Norton and more. Readers get to go behind the scenes and experience the show like never before, including personal photos. They’ll also discover the never-told fallout and divorce of the two showrunners, making the show two separate series blended into one. Even people unfamiliar with the show will gain deep insight into what it takes to put a series on television.

Typically, oral histories come out as retrospectives, based entirely on recall. This one will have the benefit of having the ending occur in real-time. From script development to final season (the 11th season will be the show's last) readers will get a glimpse of the cast’s relationships with each other and the emotions attached to saying goodbye to the best and longest-running workplace many of them expect to ever experience. Much like the series itself, this book shares a story of family, of conflict and collaboration, that went into this timeless, groundbreaking series."

John's debut memoir reads like a book of poetry or even a series of text messages. In the tone of Bukowski’s Post Office, this gifted writer captures his experiences in Japan with humor, wit, honesty, and by all means without an ounce of political correctness. 

""...Periods of hopelessness and despair are perfectly blended with hilarity and hope, instantly giving off vibes of Post Office by Charles Bukowski.

Robert’s poor dad struggled financially all his life, and these two dads—these very different points of view of money, investing, and employment—shaped Robert’s thinking about money.

Robert has challenged and changed the way tens of millions of people, around the world, think about money and investing and he has become a global advocate for financial education and the path to financial freedom. Rich Dad Poor Dad (and the Rich Dad series it spawned) has sold over 36 million copies in English and translated editions around the world.

• explode the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich
• challenge the belief that your house is an asset
• show parents why they can’t rely on the school system to teach their kids

• define, once and for all, an asset and a liability
• explain the difference between good debt and bad debt
• teach you to see the world of money from different perspectives
• discuss the shift in mindset that can put you on the road to financial freedom"

すべての投資家が知っておきたい新しい事実があります。 


本作は、投資をやっている方はもちろん、やったことがない方にも理解しやすい内容です。 


人工知能の発達が進んでいる昨今、時代の流れはますます激しくなってきています。 

そんな時代でも通用する、とっておきの投資法、それがブックメーカー投資です。 


どんな手法なのか? ぜひ本書をお楽しみください。 


【「はじめに」より】 


「夢を叶えたければ、信じて、前向きに努力したら叶う」 


私はそう思っています。なぜなら、実際に実現してきているからです。 


私の夢ですが、1つは毎月贅沢に旅行する。 

旅行は、お金がかかっちゃうものじゃないですか。 

だからといって宿泊費を削ったりだとかはせずに、いいところに泊まりたいです。 


温泉が好きなので、色んな温泉地に行きたいと思っています。 

あとは海外ですね。最近初めて行かせてもらったのですが、また海外も行きたいなって。 


2つ目は、親孝行です。 

これは私が20代の頃に「やりたいな。やりたいな」と言いながら全然できてなかったこと。 


やっぱりすごくお金かかってるんですよね、子供を育てるのに。 

今こうやって大人になってわかるんですけど。 

だからこそ「お金だけじゃなくて、なにかで返してあげたいな」という気持ちがあります。 


3つ目はあまりよくないですけど、お金持ちになりたい。 

いや、でもこれはいい言葉かもしれません。 

みんな「お金持ちになりたい」と思っている部分はあるのではないでしょうか。 


「もっと具体的に言え!」と言われたら、別の言葉があると思うんですけど、 

私は1年前に「お金持ちになりたい」と思ったところからビジネスを始めました。 


この3つの夢を持ちつつ、私はバスガイドをしていました。 

「このままずっと、バスガイドとしてやっていくのかな? 将来不安だな……」と思いながらです。 


その時に、たまたまこれからご紹介していくような情報が入ってきて、チャレンジをさせてもらい、夢が実現してきています。 


こんな感じではあるんですけども「現状を変えたい」、「夢があるのに何もできてない」、 

「時間が欲しいのに自由な時間がない」といった方々に、この本を通して私の経験からのアドバイスをさせて頂けたらと思っています。 


少しでも興味があったら、ぜひこのまま読み進めていってください。

The Audition Playbook is a two-part guide and workbook designed to help musicians of all instruments and levels efficiently and effectively plan and prepare for orchestra auditions. No matter the goal, the Audition Playbook provides the framework upon which musicians can carefully create, implement, and follow their own plans from start to finish.



Many factors go into having a successful audition and every winner will tell you about wildly different tools and secrets that set them apart from the pack. Every person—and every audition—is different. However, there are certain elements that tend to be universal among audition winners, and often, the most important factor is simply having a plan—a thoughtful, deliberate plan—and sticking with it.



The Audition Playbook is not a ""one-size-fits-all"" template and does not set out to plan your entire audition for you.  ""Part One: The Guide"" offers an overview of the the many different facets of audition preparation to consider and provides tools, suggestions, and exercises to implement into your own plan. ""Part Two: The Workbook"" provides the canvas upon which you will build your personal audition plan.



Among the many topics covered: 



The four phases of audition preparation 
Goal-setting and re-setting
Taking honest assessments of your technique, knowledge of the repertoire, and other skills 
Planning your daily and weekly practicing
The development of performance skills 
Planning for the unexpected 
Recording your practice
Mock auditions
Writing your ""Audition Day Script"" 
Reflecting on your auditions



There are no rules or requirements to the Audition Playbook other than to have a plan, write everything down, stick with it, and adjust accordingly! Whether you're already a regular on the audition trail, a first-timer new to the world of auditions, or an already-established professional looking to up your game, the Audition Playbook is for you. 



The principles and tools offered in the Audition Playbook extend beyond the orchestral audition and can be applied to musical performances and auditions of all types.



**



Rachelle Jenkins is an accomplished horn player who has played with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Montréal Symphony, Iceland Symphony, Hawaii Symphony, and many other orchestras and chamber ensembles around the world. She studied at The Colburn School, McGill University, and the University of Central Florida.

Uncounted millions of “international” transactions occur daily, as goods and services are purchased across the national boundaries of some 200 political units. Capital flows from nation to nation, and so—to a lesser extent—do jobs, as companies seek more favorable locations for their business operations. The “rules” (laws) governing these exchanges quickly become complex, as persons (and governments) from different countries are involved. If problems arise in a cross-border relationship, whose rules apply? What forums are available to resolve disputes? Are there tax implications to the transaction? If so, where? These and similar questions need to be factored into the decision to “go overseas.”

Each of the six chapters in this book begins with a brief overview of the subject-matter, followed by short previews of the chosen case examples. The primary content of the chapters consists of some 120 court and arbitration decisions in real disputes, between real parties. The actual text of the decisions in these cases has been edited; some excerpts are quite brief, others are more substantial. Most “background” facts have been summarized by the author, but the edited-decision part of each case is quoted from the actual recorded text of the court or arbitrator who decided it. Clearly, a minute sample from tens of thousands of cases cannot provide comprehensive coverage of what all the world’s legal rules are. Our objectives here are simply to indicate some of the major potential “flash points” of doing international business, to illustrate some of the significant differences in the applicable legal rules, and to provide an exposure to the language and process by which international business disputes are resolved. “Fore-warned is fore-armed.” Being aware of these potential trouble spots, a sensible business manager will presumably consider them in making the decision to engage in cross-border transactions, and take appropriate steps to avoid or minimize potential adverse consequences.

Chapter I of this book introduces International Law—its course of development and its two major sources (custom and treaties). Chapter II examines the use of national and international courts and arbitrators to resolve cross-border disputes. Chapter III provides basic coverage of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods: when it applies, how the sale contract is formed, when risk of loss on the goods passes from Seller to Buyer, and what responsibilities the Seller has for the quality of the goods sold. Chapter IV looks at some of the legal questions that might arise in conducting cross-border commercial operations—employment issues, intellectual property issues, and investment issues. Chapter V considers potential questions regarding taxation of international activities, and the regulation of adverse environmental effects. Chapter VI reviews the efforts by national governments to apply their competition regulations to international business transactions, and the difficulties that private parties might have in attempting to enforce legal claims against governments and their agencies. While these are surely not the only legal issues that might arise in connection with international business, they do constitute a significant set of concerns of which managers need to be aware as they venture into the international “stream of commerce.”"

That approach is not sustainable in the face of ongoing issues such as global climate change, environmental damage, rising inequality and enduring poverty. Alternatives must be found.

This open access book addresses that challenge. It sets out a wellbeing economics framework that directly addresses fundamental issues affecting wellbeing outcomes. Drawing inspiration from the capabilities approach of Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen, the book demonstrates how persons can enhance prosperity through their own actions and through collaboration with others.

The book examines national public policy, but its analysis also focuses on choices made by individuals, households, families, civil society, local government and the global community. It therefore offers important insights for anyone concerned with improving personal wellbeing and community prosperity.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Discover ingenious techniques to overcome fear, greed, and the cognitive biases that are sapping your profit potential.

Trading should be easy, but sometimes our brains make it tough. It’s not our fault, evolution has hard-wired human beings to fail in the markets. Fear, greed, and other destructive emotions harass us into making poor decisions.

Most trading teachers will tell you to “run your winners and cut your losses early,” and “banish fear and greed if you want to succeed.” Great advice, but let’s face it, it’s about as useful as saying “if you want to quit smoking, stop putting cigarettes in your mouth”. If only it was that easy!

Anyone who trades knows it can be hard to take a loss or to run a winner. That’s because your brain is actively working against you when you trade. Fear and greed are two of its biggest weapons, and it won’t hesitate to deploy them against your best efforts to turn a profit.

But what would happen if, instead of hampering your trading, your fear and greed worked for you? What if you could harness their power and energy and use them for good? Trading would become stress-free, and bigger profits would follow.

In this groundbreaking new book, Harvey Walsh goes further than ever before in deconstructing the evolutionary developments and learned behaviours that have programmed us for failure in the markets. Armed with that information, he has developed a series of brain hacks - simple yet powerful tricks and techniques anyone can use to turn around their built-in disadvantages and use them to supercharge their trading.

Here’s just some of what you’ll discover when you read Brain Hacks For Traders:


 -	How to make your trading stress-free by subverting your fear-engine.
 -	Ingenious brain hacks to boost your performance and profit by commandeering your inbuilt cognitive biases and heuristics.
 -	How to harness the awesome power of addiction and have it improve every single trade you take.
 -	A simple but smart tactic that will trick your mind into revealing what’s really on a chart.
 -	What a racing driver’s pants can teach us about human fallibility, and how that same weakness can become our saviour.
 -	How to slay the monsters that haunt every trader, and build an impenetrable shield against self-doubt.
 -	The one document every trader needs to improve their entry selection exponentially.
 -	What cheat-heuristics are, why they’re good for you, and how to use them ethically.
 -	How trading less can mean you make more money.
 -	Five different ways to beat the boredom and keep yourself focussed. You can’t profit from a trade you missed, so make sure you don’t miss any.

Brain Hacks For Traders is perfect for traders working in any market and any time frame. Scalpers, day traders, and swing traders will all benefit. The techniques in the book apply to any instrument too, be it stocks, futures, forex, options, or commodities.

Give yourself an edge: hack your brain and take your trading and your profits to the next level. Because trading needn’t be tough."

But, unlike most money books, it's not focused on making you the richest person in your street, or worse, the richest person in the cemetery. Instead, the focus of this book is on gaining choice.

Have you ever listened to a guest on a radio program or a speaker at an event talking about some amazing experience they've had? Perhaps it was travelling through Tibet in a beaten-up Land Rover, sailing around the world, jumping out of planes in a wing suit, or starting a business or charity of their own, driven by a magnitude 10 passion to make an impact.

When you listened to these inspiring stories, did you ever wonder how they managed to organise their life so that it was possible? Do you wish you could organise your life to do what's important to you?

Financial Autonomy is a book about money but it's equally about gaining choice. If you get the money side of your life right, you will have the choice to pursue maximum happiness in all the other aspects of your life.

Personal finance expert Paul Benson believes there are three vehicles to create enough wealth to have the choices you desire are: 

(1) Investing in shares; 

(2) Investing in property; and 

(3) Working for yourself (starting a side hustle or small business).

And yet, whenever somebody discovers that I am deaf, my body still reacts with churning terror. How do you build up a sense of robust pride when your body has taught itself to be fearful?

Fiona Murphy’s memoir about being deaf is a revelation.

Secrets are heavy, burdensome things. Imagine carrying a secret that if exposed could jeopardise your chances of securing a job and make you a social outcast. Fiona Murphy kept her deafness a secret for over twenty-five years.

But then, desperate to hold onto a career she’d worked hard to pursue, she tried hearing aids. Shocked by how the world sounded, she vowed never to wear them again. After an accident to her hand, she discovered that sign language could change her life, and that Deaf culture could be part of her identity.

Just as Fiona thought she was beginning to truly accept her body, she was diagnosed with a rare condition that causes the bones of the ears to harden. She was steadily losing her residual hearing. The news left her reeling.

Blending memoir with observations on the healthcare industry, The Shape of Sound is a story about the corrosive power of secrets, stigma and shame, and how deaf experiences and disability are shaped by economics, social policy, medicine and societal expectations.

This is the story of how Fiona learns to listen to her body. If you enjoy the writing of Bri Lee and Fiona Wright, this is a book for you.

Fiona Murphy is a Deaf poet and essayist. Her work has been published in Kill Your Darlings, Overland, Griffith Review and the Big Issue, among other publications. In 2019, she was awarded the Overland Fair Australia Essay Prize and the Monash Undergraduate Creative Writing Prize. In 2018, she was shortlisted for the Richell Prize and highly commended by the Wheeler Centre Next Chapter program."

Based on Ian’s highly successful and popular training courses, the book provides a simple and easily remembered model for solving managerial problems and managing staff effectively. Managerial problems are always the result of one or more of the following five factors: the CLARITY of the instruction, the staff member’s COMMITMENT to the task, his or her SELF-IMAGE, the ‘PRICE’ that he or she must pay in order to carry out the task, and his or her type of BEHAVIOUR.

The book unpacks each of these five factors and gives practical ways of mastering them. The model is compelling and elegantly simple so it sticks vividly in the manager’s mind. It provides an easy guide to diagnosing problems and implementing solutions that work. This is what has made Ian Mann’s training sessions so immensely popular and successful – and now it is available in book form."

Egeus offers his daughter Hermia a choice. She can either marry Demetrius, the man he chose for her, become a nun, or be put to death. Hermia goes with a fourth option: running into the forest to elope with her lover Lysander. Demetrius follows, and Hermia's best friend Helena (herself in love with Demetrius) follows after him.


The love triangle is complicated enough as it is, but when the faerie king Oberon, along with the troublemaker spirit Puck, pulls a prank on his queen involving a love potion, human and faerie alike are tangled up in a hilarious web of confusion and unpredictable romances."

Finding it freakin’ impossible to write an About Page for your website?

Whether you’re new to entrepreneurship and just starting out with your first website or you’re a seasoned entrepreneur having a website overhaul, writing an About Page that feels authentic is seriously tough.

But why is taking the time to get it right even important?

Listen, whether you’ve got a simple blog or a fully-fledged business, the primary goal of your website is to turn visitors into email subscribers.

Why?

Because email subscribers are THE key to business success. The people on your email list are the tribe of people you’re gonna love and nurture. They're the people who are gonna buy your products and services.

Followers on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are all terribly lovely, but you don’t own those followers. If Twitter disappeared tomorrow, you’d have no way of reaching those people. Same goes for Facebook, Instagram and all the other social media channels.

But when someone gives you their email address, that’s not going to disappear. And the more people you have on your email list, the more potential clients and customers you can reach directly through email. And believe me, that’s gold. Or maybe even platinum. Whatever, it’s really valuable.

So that’s the primary goal of your website. And your About Page, being one of the most visited pages of your site, is one of the best places to fulfil that goal.

But like I said, writing an About Page can be pretty darn difficult. 

In this short ebook, I’ll take you through, step-by-step, how to write a non-sucky About Page that turns website visitors into subscribers, raving fans and dream clients.

As well the ebook edition, you’ll also get:

He  gave up a six-figure income as a lawyer to make $12 an hour as a personal  trainer.  Then, married with a 3-month old baby, he signed a lease to  launch  a yoga center in the heart of New York City. . . the day before 9/11.   But  he survived, and along the way he developed a fresh approach to  transforming  uncertainty, risk of loss, and exposure to judgment into catalysts for  innovation, creation, and achievement.
Properly understood and harnessed, fear and uncertainty can become  fuel for creative genius rather than sources of pain, anxiety, and  suffering. In business, art, and life, creating on a world-class level  demands bold action and leaps of faith in the face of great uncertainty.  But  that uncertainty can lead to fear, anxiety, paralysis, and destruction.  It  can gut creativity and stifle innovation. It can keep you from taking the  risks necessary to do great work and craft a deeply-rewarding life. And  it  can bring companies that rely on innovation grinding to a halt.

That is, unless you know how to use it to your advantage. 
Fields draws on leading-edge technology, cognitive-science and ancient  awareness-focusing techniques in a fresh, practical, non-dogmatic way.  His  approach enables creativity and productivity on an entirely different  level  and can turn the once-tortuous journey into a more enjoyable quest.              Fields will reveal how to: 
Make changes to your workflow that unlock buried creative  potential.      Build ""creation hives"" -- supportive groups that can supercharge  and  humanize the process.     Tap social technology and user co-creation to add clarity,  certainty,  and sanity, even if you're an artist or solo-creator.     Develop a set of personal practices and mindset shifts that let you  not just tolerate, but invite and even amplify, uncertainty as a  catalyst for genius.        
Drawing on extensive case studies and research, Fields shares a set  of detailed personal practices and environmental changes that can not  only humanize the creative process, but also allow individuals and  teams to stay more open to opportunity and play a bigger creative game."

“Why did I just blow $300K promoting a whitepaper?”

That’s the hard question I asked myself but couldn’t answer—after all, we were just following the same old SaaS playbook. Sure, sales cycles were long and acquisition was expensive, but that’s how everybody grew their companies.

But after I helped launch a freemium product that went from 0-100K users in less than 12 months, I realized the traditional way of selling software was deeply flawed.

Hi, I’m Wes Bush, founder of the Product-Led Institute. And in Product-Led Growth, I show you how you can cut your acquisition costs and scale further than you ever thought possible...by making your product the tool that helps you acquire, convert, and retain customers.

But what does it mean to be “product-led”? How do you know if a product-led growth strategy makes sense for your business? And most importantly, how do you execute it?

You’ll find answers to all of these questions inside this book. In addition, I’ll also show you:

	
How to save 3-6 months of development and hundreds of thousands of dollars by launching a free trial in 24 hours—and why you should do it (Ch. 10)

Which HUGE mistake ProfitWell's Patrick Campbell says can ""kill your growth and set you up for long-term failure""...and how to avoid making it (Ch. 8)

Which of the 4 most common SaaS pricing strategies is the ONLY one with long-term viability (Ch. 9)

What the ""Triple-A"" sprint cycle is and how to use it to build a sustainable growth process—in just 1 month (Ch. 12)

How to stop paying customers from slipping away (Ch. 15)

The 3 apocalyptic ""tidal waves"" that are coming for SaaS companies—and what you MUST do to survive them (Ch. 1)

How to make free trial and freemium users hunger to upgrade to paid (Ch. 9)

The single biggest cause of leaky funnels and how to fix it, fast (Ch. 10)

Which 7 people you need in your “tiger team” to run a successful product-led growth team (Ch. 11)

The #1 thing to improve right now to maximize your customer lifetime value (Ch. 14)



Product-Led Growth also comes packed with “do this, not that” real-life examples from the industry’s biggest brands—as well as a collection of high-converting email scripts you can customize and send out immediately to turn more users into customers.

Many investors, including some with substantial portfolios, have only the sketchiest idea of how the stock market works. The reason, say Lynch and Rothchild, is that the basics of investing—the fundamentals of our economic system and what they have to do with the stock market—aren’t taught in school. At a time when individuals have to make important decisions about saving for college and 401(k) retirement funds, this failure to provide a basic education in investing can have tragic consequences.

 For those who know what to look for, investment opportunities are everywhere. The average high school student is familiar with Nike, Reebok, McDonald’s, the Gap, and The Body Shop. Nearly every teenager in America drinks Coke or Pepsi, but only a very few own shares in either company or even understand how to buy them. Every student studies American history, but few realize that our country was settled by European colonists financed by public companies in England and Holland—and the basic principles behind public companies haven’t changed in more than three hundred years.

 In Learn to Earn, Lynch and Rothchild explain in a style accessible to anyone who is high school age or older how to read a stock table in the daily newspaper, how to understand a company annual report, and why everyone should pay attention to the stock market. They explain not only how to invest, but also how to think like an investor."

Originally published in 1994 and first revised in 2010, The Art of Photography has sold well over 100,000 copies and has firmly established itself as the most readable, understandable, and complete textbook on photography. Featuring nearly 200 beautiful photographs in both black-and-white and color, as well as numerous charts, graphs, and tables, this book presents the world of photography to beginner, intermediate, and advanced photographers who seek to make a personal statement through the medium of photography.

Without talking down to anyone or talking over anyone's head, renowned photographer, teacher, and author Bruce Barnbaum presents how-to techniques for both traditional and digital approaches. In this newest edition of the book, Barnbaum has included many new images and has completely revised the text, with particular focus on two crucial chapters covering digital photography: he revised a chapter covering the digital zone system, and includes a brand-new chapter on image adjustments using digital tools. There is also a new chapter discussing the concepts of “art versus technique” and “traditional versus digital” approaches to photography. Throughout the book, Barnbaum goes well beyond the technical, as he delves deeply into the philosophical, expressive, and creative aspects of photography so often avoided in other books.

Barnbaum is recognized as one of the world's finest landscape and architectural photographers, and for decades has been considered one of the best instructors in the field of photography. This latest incarnation of his textbook—which has evolved, grown, and been refined over the past 45 years—will prove to be an ongoing, invaluable photographic reference for years to come. It is truly the resource of choice for the thinking photographer.Topics include:

He becomes a real value investor. In this fascinating inside story, Guy Spier details his career from Harvard MBA to hedge fund manager. But the path was not so straightforward. Spier reveals his transformation from a Gordon Gekko wannabe, driven by greed, to a sophisticated investor who enjoys success without selling his soul to the highest bidder. Spier's journey is similar to the thousands that flock to Wall Street every year with their shiny new diplomas, aiming to be King of Wall Street. Yet what Guy realized just in the nick of time was that the King really lived 1,500 miles away in Omaha, Nebraska. Spier determinedly set out to create a new career in his own way. Along the way he learned some powerful lessons which include: why the right mentors and partners are critical to long term success on Wall Street; why a topnotch education can sometimes get in the way of your success; that real learning doesn't begin until you are on your own; and how the best lessons from Warren Buffett have less to do with investing and more to do with being true to yourself. Spier also reveals some of his own winning investment strategies, detailing deals that were winners but also what he learned from deals that went south. Part memoir, part Wall Street advice, and part how-to, Guy Spier takes readers on a ride through Wall Street but more importantly provides those that want to take a different path with the insight, guidance, and inspiration they need to carve out their own definition of success."

This book collects TV and movie critic Matt Zoller Seitz’s celebrated Mad Men recaps—as featured on New York magazine's Vulture blog—for the first time, including never-before-published essays on the show’s first three seasons. Seitz’s writing digs deep into the show’s themes, performances, and filmmaking, examining complex and sometimes confounding aspects of the series. The complete series—all seven seasons and ninety-two episodes—is covered.
  
 Each episode review also includes brief explanations of locations, events, consumer products, and scientific advancements that are important to the characters, such as P.J. Clarke’s restaurant and the old Penn Station; the inventions of the birth control pill, the Xerox machine, and the Apollo Lunar Module; the release of the Beatles’ Revolver and the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds; and all the wars, protests, assassinations, and murders that cast a bloody pall over a chaotic decade.  
Mad Men Carousel is named after an iconic moment from the show’s first-season finale, “The Wheel,” wherein Don delivers an unforgettable pitch for a new slide projector that’s centered on the idea of nostalgia: “the pain from an old wound.” This book will soothe the most ardent Mad Men fan’s nostalgia for the show. New viewers, who will want to binge-watch their way through one of the most popular TV shows in recent memory, will discover a spoiler-friendly companion to one of the most multilayered and mercurial TV shows of all time.

 “A must-read that hopefully will be adapted for the screen. Greene lets Wilzig’s effervescent spirit shine through, and his story will appeal to a wide variety of readers.” - Library Journal

Unstoppable is the ultimate immigrant story and an epic David-and-Goliath adventure. While American teens were socializing in ice cream parlors, Siggi was suffering beatings by Nazi hoodlums for being a Jew and was soon deported along with his family to the darkest place the world has ever known: Auschwitz. Siggi used his wits to stay alive, pretending to have trade skills the Nazis could exploit to run the camp. After two death marches and near starvation, he was liberated from camp Mauthausen and went to work for the US Army hunting Nazis, a service that earned him a visa to America. On arrival, he made three vows: to never go hungry again, to support the Jewish people, and to speak out against injustice. He earned his first dollar shoveling snow after a fierce blizzard. His next job was laboring in toxic sweatshops. From these humble beginnings, he became President, Chairman and CEO of a New York Stock Exchange-listed oil company and grew a full-service commercial bank to more than $4 billion in assets.

 Siggi’s ascent from the darkest of yesterdays to the brightest of tomorrows holds sway over the imagination in this riveting narrative of grit, cunning, luck, and the determination to live life to the fullest."

The recent peace process, however, gives the country new opportunities to develop its economy with less interference due to internal conflict. This research monograph investigates how Nepal might seize these opportunities by increasing agricultural growth and poverty reduction through improvements in roads, irrigation, and rural extension. The authors evaluate the impact of public investments in these areas by using two types of data and methodology: a hedonic approach that relates access to public infrastructure and services to land value and a panel of household-level data on consumption, poverty, and income. The hedonic methodology suggests a positive relationship between investments in irrigation and extension and household welfare, although the panel data approach suggests otherwise. This result reinforces the importance of methodology in evaluating rural investments. Rural roads yielded more clear-cut findings, however: both approaches agree that investment there has a positive relationship with household welfare, as measured in land values, consumption growth, poverty reduction, or agricultural income growth. The authors recommend increased public investments in rural roads, irrigation, and extension, as well as further research into precisely how infrastructure and services affect rural households’ welfare and how their effectiveness can be improved. This monograph will be useful to policymakers, researchers, and others concerned with Nepal’s future development."

Van Alstyne, and Sangeet Paul Choudary reveal the what, how, and why of this revolution and provide the first “owner’s manual” for creating a successful platform business.

Platform Revolution teaches newcomers how to start and run a successful platform business, explaining ways to identify prime markets and monetize networks. Addressing current business leaders, the authors reveal strategies behind some of today’s up-and-coming platforms, such as Tinder and SkillShare, and explain how traditional companies can adapt in a changing marketplace. The authors also cover essential issues concerning security, regulation, and consumer trust, while examining markets that may be ripe for a platform revolution, including healthcare, education, and energy.

As digital networks increase in ubiquity, businesses that do a better job of harnessing the power of the platform will win. An indispensable guide, Platform Revolution charts out the brilliant future of platforms and reveals how they will irrevocably alter the lives and careers of millions."

Life insists we do things like:

Get out of bed.
Study for exams.
Show up for work.
Think about exercise.
Make sales calls.

The list goes on and on. There are so many mind-numbing things we know we should do, but our minds and bodies say, ""No!"" So what do we really need?

How about strategies we can actually use?

Instead of feeling defeated and sluggish, we can take iron-fisted control of our minds and get motivated in less than 60 seconds.

We can struggle, feel guilty, and fight motivation fatigue for the rest of our lives, or we can learn how to be smarter than our unmotivated brains.

Life is short. Let’s feel motivated to do what we have to do.

No need to suffer. Let our minds work for us, instead of against us.

Gerhard Badrian was a gentle soul – quiet and compassionate, a competent commercial photographer. The Nazi occupation of Holland changed him. To cope with ruthless tyranny, his first reaction was perfectly normal. Keep your head down, stay out of harm’s way.

But that didn’t satisfy him, so he joined the Resistance. He learnt to forge identity papers which saved hundreds of likely Nazi victims: Resistance members, Jews and others.

 

Still not enough. When, in front of his eyes, he saw his parents captured and deported to their deaths, a new persona emerged. He found he had hidden talents. He was a natural-born actor. Armed with forged papers and wearing an SS uniform, he would march into a prison or hospital… 

 

Certainly, this is a thrilling war story, an engrossing Holocaust story. But it is also a family story. Gerhard was the author’s mother’s cousin. For Paul Gardner, Gerhard Badrian is his unsung family hero.

 

""A gripping story of how extraordinary times converted ordinary people into heroes ... This book transforms the history of a global war and monstrous crimes against humanity into a personal story of courage, risk and heart-trembling fear."" - The Hon. Michael Kirby AC CMG"

Conversations can lead to an engaged and energized workforce, or to one that is alienated and uninspired. If you want to change the culture you must change the conversations.

All too often workplace conversations—between managers and direct reports, peer-to-peer, or with external stakeholders— create parent-child relationships. People hide facts, sugarcoat reality and claim helplessness to try to control interactions and get what they want. The Showkeirs expose the destructiveness of these manipulative conversations, and demonstrate how we can move to honest and authentic interactions that create adult relationships. By intentionally and thoughtfully changing conversations, organizations will engender increased commitment, true accountability, and improved workplace performance.

Drawing on more than 25 years of experience as organizational consultants, their book offers examples of parent-child and adult-adult workplace conversations in a variety of settings, circumstances and industries. They also provide a hands-on guide, including sample scripts, for dealing with a host of potentially difficult conversations.

Authentic Conversations goes to the heart of why so many people today are disengaged, uninspired, and uncommitted to their organization’s success. It challenges the conventional wisdom about managing people and sets out specific, concrete ways to consciously make conversations the primary driver for change."

Unfortunately though, our energy is finite and when we push too far or too fast we will inevitably burn out and have to give up.

This is not only very upsetting because it means we aren’t able to do everything we would like to – it’s also a very unpleasant feeling that leaves us drained, exhausted and prone to illness. What’s worse, we tend to become moody, we lose all interest in the things that normally switch us on and we generally become shadows of our former selves.

And even when you aren’t trying so hard to push past your limits and ’fit everything in’ it’s still all-too easy to reach burnout. Our modern lifestyle it seems is just jam packed with things to do and places to be. If you’re not rushing around and staying late at work, you’re travelling home on a busy and crowded commute or you’re tidying the house, responding to e-mails and juggling your social life and family responsibilities. Is it any wonder that so many of us feel fit to explode?

Many of us will even know that we’re working towards burnout and feel almost completely powerless to stop it. We can feel the cold developing in the back of our throat, our eyes are starting to feel heavy and we would do anything just to get ten minutes to sit down and read a book with a cup of tea…

We often know when burnout is on the way but unfortunately it tends to be somewhat inevitable. And what follows is days or weeks of low energy, bad moods and illness. Burnout can even cause bad skin, impotence and low libido, weight gain or loss and accidents. It’s no laughing matter.

Sometimes we’ll even work through the burnout – never quite recovering, never quite doing our best work and never really enjoying anything that life has to offer. In fact, there’s a good chance that’s how you feel right now and that you’re just perpetually burned out."

Using gold as an example of this term, he traces the layers of this ancient currency from raw mined material, to gold coins, and finally to bank-issued gold certificates. In a groundbreaking manner, Bhatia offers a similar paradigm for the evolution of digital currencies. Bhatia's analysis begins in Renaissance Florence with the gold Florin coin and a burgeoning banking culture, continues with the evolution of central banking, and concludes with a vision for the future of our international monetary system. As central banks around the world prepare to launch their own crypto-competitors, Bhatia illustrates how the invention of Bitcoin created a seismic shift in money and merged the monetary and cryptography sciences. His unique analysis of ""layered money"" illuminates money markets for the general reader and shows how Bitcoin is becoming a trusted global currency. Readers will come away with an understanding of the mechanics of our financial system, why the dollar is deeply entrenched despite its state of disrepair, and how Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and cryptocurrencies will interact in our new monetary future."

It’s about influencing someone to follow directions, agree with your position, take action or approve your business case.

Take what you think you know about writing in your job and turn it on its head. You probably thought it was about being clear and concise so the recipient would understand it. If so, you’d be wrong.

If you want to be successful, you need to think about your writing differently – What it’s really about is influencing others. You probably learned in high school or college English classes all about how to write, but they rarely focus on how to communicate, much less influence with your communications.

Business communications in college is often more about formatting letters, the traditional headings to use’ formal structure, numbering, using appendices, numbering, creating technical documents and more. What it doesn’t prepare you for is how to use your business writing to influence others, a key skill to being successful manager and climbing the corporate ladder.

And, it’s not a lot of help in the high tech, fast paced communications world we live in today.

According to Wikipaedia, communication is simply about conveying information. In fact, the important part of communication isn’t just about conveying information, it’s making sure the information you convey delivers the results you need by influencing the reader.

Think about what you write in your job. Do you write procedures? If so, you shouldn’t simply want people to understand them, you want them to follow them. That’s influence. If you write business cases, you don’t want to lay out a clear, logical argument; you want the reader to give you approval – that’s influence. If you write letters and emails, it isn’t about being readable, with good grammar and accurate spelling. If you think about it, you are always trying to get someone to do something, whether it’s agree with you, approve something, or do what you want.

Few managers are well equipped for this shift in what writing mean, partly because of what we’ve been taught in school about writing and the way communication has been defined for us in the past.

The first step is to know what you want, then craft your written communication not only to convey information, you need to make sure it influence others.

This book gives you the techniques you need to change your writing from simply conveying information to influencing others.

This is the first book in the Quick Guide for Managers Series."

How did this happen? Why was a publisher, a financier, a manufacturer of novelties, able to make so very much money with a book that is about putting sentences together? Are the sentences contained in the pages that follow actually that powerful? Are they far more universally adaptable than I had first thought... so they are no longer about advertising products, but literally about opening whole new markets for them? 

This book outwardly talks about the sentences that make up the primary appeal of that product to that market. But its true and deeper message is found when it is interpreted as a market-diviner, and a market-intensifier. In other words, its message will show you how to find your ""dream"" market, and how to drive it into a national ""feeding frenzy.""

The Measuring the Co-operative Difference Research Network and the Centre of Excellence in Accounting and Reporting for Co-operatives joined forces to organize an international conference, focused on how and why co-operatives assess their performance and their impacts on society.

Academics and practitioners gathered to share their research and experiences with a variety of accounting and reporting tools and practices. The event offered an unprecedented opportunity to recognize and debate various reporting needs and practices, to hear from practitioners regarding the purpose and methods of reporting in their co-operatives, and to identify the building blocks for the establishment of key supports for co-operatives engaged in performance measuring and reporting.

Over a period of 3 days co-operative practitioners and researchers from Europe, North America and Latin America discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the various tools used by co-operatives, and considered how best to obtain and share reliable and accurate information on co-operative performance and impact. Participants agreed that in addition to being useful for co-operatives as part of their self-evaluation and strategic planning processes, the sharing of information resulting from use of various tools and reporting practices can help co-operatives in the implementation of the strategy for sustainable growth of the co-operative movement, outlined in the Blueprint for a Co-operative Decade.

The key questions posed by the conference organizers were: What do co-operatives report and why? What tools exist and what is missing? Which tools set co-operatives apart from other business forms (and do they measure the co-operative identity)? Which tools are standard in respective industries and are co-operatives leaders or followers in those efforts?

The conference was exploring five interconnected themes:
1) Statistics and data collection
2) Putting co-operative principles into practice
3) Community impact
4) Member and stakeholder engagement
5) Reporting practices (co-operative identity and sustainability)

The chapters in this book are organized according to these five themes. They offer an international snapshot of the work being undertaken in these areas, with the intention of sharing the knowledge and experience obtained thus far. The authors advocate a critical analysis of these materials, and suggest ways forward as practitioners and researchers address the reporting and dissemination challenges identified during the conference."

One of Canadian artist Emily Carr’s paintings sold for more than $3.3 million in 2013, setting a record for work by a Canadian woman. And Carr was just as gifted as an author as she was a painter.


In Klee Wyck she shares literary sketches of her experiences among the First Nations of Canada’s west coast. We travel alongside Carr as she meets generous and curious people who, despite their initial distrust, open their hearts and minds to Klee Wyck (the ""Laughing One""), as they call her. Carr describes the poverty and challenges these indigenous communities face, and she marvels at their pride, traditions, and the artistry of their totem poles. Be on the lookout for sections of Carr’s memoir that were originally removed, including a portrait of a mixed-race family and vignettes condemning European missionaries. These deleted passages were finally released in 2004."

The pressure is on. Your board must own up to its accountability for the performance of the corporation. Governance now means leadership. Boards must change their modus operandi to address the new and complex issues that are emerging. These include

He describes best practices that are emerging in boardrooms he has observed firsthand.

In just ten minutes, The Meeting, as it would forever be known, would begin.  Casey had every reason to believe that his performance over the next two hours would determine the fate of his career, his financial future, and the company he had built from scratch.

“How could my life have unraveled so quickly?” he wondered.

In his latest page-turning work of business fiction, best-selling author Patrick Lencioni provides readers with another powerful and thought-provoking book, this one centered around a cure for the most painful yet underestimated problem of modern business: bad meetings.  And what he suggests is both simple and revolutionary.

Casey McDaniel, the founder and CEO of Yip Software, is in the midst of a problem he created, but one he doesn’t know how to solve.  And he doesn’t know where or who to turn to for advice.  His staff can’t help him; they’re as dumbfounded as he is by their tortuous meetings.

Then an unlikely advisor, Will Peterson, enters Casey’s world.  When he proposes an unconventional, even radical, approach to solving the meeting problem, Casey is just desperate enough to listen.

As in his other books, Lencioni provides a framework for his groundbreaking model, and makes it applicable to the real world.  Death by Meeting is nothing short of a blueprint for leaders who want to eliminate waste and frustration among their teams, and create environments of engagement and passion."

But sometimes, it gets it wrong. This book is a very funny, light-hearted (but deeply informed) look at Oscar upsets throughout history: who won, who should have won, and the given circumstances, political, cultural and otherwise, contributing to decisions that history has proven wrong-headed.

The book begins with the very first Oscar ceremony of 1927/8, when the Academy was still finding its feet and awarding prizes in strange (now defunct) categories, and includes entries covering almost every year, up to and including this year’s Oscars.

Along the way, the chronological coverage is interspersed with sections entitled “Special Figures in Oscar History”: stand-alone chapters of considerable depth that examine Hollywood figures who, for reasons we examine closely, were perpetual “bridesmaids” at the Oscars.

The book not only looks at the social, political and economic forces contributing to the decisions of the Academy; it also continually examines the state of the Academy, Hollywood, and the movie-going public along the way. It takes in changing public mores, tastes and expectations. Indeed, while being a book about the Oscars, it is also a history of the great films of Hollywood.

That said, this is the opposite of a dry book. It is subjective, chatty - indeed, often gossipy - and very funny. Any fan of the Oscars, Hollywood and the movies will love this book."

In order to make Bianca available, her suitors begin searching for a potential match, and find it in the equally strong-willed Petruchio.

Although the proportion of hungry people around the world has declined since 1990, global hunger remains at a level characterized as “serious.” Global Hunger Index scores vary greatly across regions and countries.


This year’s report focuses particularly on how to ensure sustainable food security under conditions of land, water, and energy stresses. As a result of increasing natural resource scarcity—owing to population growth, higher incomes, unsustainable resource consumption, and poor policies and weak institutions—sustainable food security is now inextricably linked to developments in the land, water, and energy sectors. The stark reality is that the world needs to produce more food with fewer resources, while eliminating wasteful practices and policies. Many countries have started to rethink agriculture and food security strategies, and this rethinking provides an opportunity to ensure that food security strategies are aligned with plans related to scarce natural resources.


By drawing attention to the countries and regions most severely affected by hunger, the Global Hunger Index, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in collaboration with Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, aims to trigger action to reduce hunger."

It uses the 'IdeaTree', a five-part colour-coded diagram of process which enables all stages to be clearly visualised - and applied.The IdeaTree diagram is based on the process philosophy developed by Peter Harris in his MA thesis in Philosophy, 'Process and Inquiry', finished in 1995. Since then he has gone on to become the builder of Cafe Eutopia, a fantasy author, inventor, sculptor, bookbinder, etc. So, Peter knows the process of creation from the inside, as well as theoretically, and uses some examples from his life to help explain the theory.  The IdeaTree diagram throws light on all areas of life, since life IS process. It also makes it clear just how people who specialise in the creative 'zone', can fit in with the other essential aspects of life and work, in a dynamic balance. Creative people do not have to be isolated and frustrated! They have an essential place in the cycle of growth of any group, society, business, or nation. Now more than ever, as our global economy becomes more and more dynamic and fast-evolving, the creative zone is in hot demand. Yet there is still fear and suspicion of creativity and the people who go in for it. This book aims to help change that by showing that creativity is an essential aspect of all life, yet it does not exist in mysterious isolation, but is simply the second of the four phases of all process: Input, Novelty, Reaction and Output.(The fifth part of the IdeaTree diagram is the 'Status Quo', made up of all the successful cycles of creation which have happened already. The Status Quo 'feeds' the process, while the new cycles are emerging.)These big concepts are distilled into this clear little book, making a deceptively simple tool for revolutionising the way we think - and create."

•Gold has already been found in over 75% of the United States - 38 of the 50 states.
•That the U.S. Geological Survey, the premier geologic science agency of the U.S. Government conservatively estimates that there are over 13,200 metric tons of gold still undiscovered in the lower 48 states.

•The estimate of undiscovered gold in the lower 48 states is almost 3 times the estimate of undiscovered gold in Alaska. (And yet most Americans don’t even think of looking for gold in the lower 48 states.)
•The U.S. Geological Survey says that 77.2+ million ounces of undiscovered gold is waiting to be collected east of the Rocky Mountains (worth approximately $92.6 Billion).
•The U.S.G.S. says that 347.2+ million ounces of undiscovered gold is waiting to be collected west of the Rocky Mountains (worth approximately $416.6Billion).
•One of the largest gold deposits in the western hemisphere with proven gold reserves of over 100 Million+ ounces ($67.5+ Billion) was discovered as recently as the 1960’s.
•A Gold mine in Wisconsin State produced $2.0+ Billion worth of Gold, Silver, and Copper between1993 and 1997.

  We fell in love with them on Gogglebox, where their warmth, cheeky gags and unending love for each other shone through our screens. When Leon sadly died at Christmas 2017, after spending every day since 1955 with his beloved June, the nation was left heartbroken. In this nostalgic, beautifully written book, June looks back at their time together, sharing treasured memories of a life truly well-lived.

  She tells of their courtship as students in the 1950s - how they fought to marry despite their parents' disapproval, and just what living in 1960s Liverpool was like. Building a life together, creating a family in their loving home, Liverpool was a place Leon and June would never move from.

  They experienced their fair share of highs and lows, but always got through everything together. As Leon often reminded himself: 'As long as June's here, I'm all right.'

To the Point. To Help High Performers Become Even More Productive

Results are what matter the most to you. You want to be a reliable producer of value in your chosen domain: whether it's your career, business, sports, studies, non-profit endeavors, or any other undertaking requiring intense focus.

You'd like to learn how to become more productive, but your time is precious, and you don't have time for a five-hundred-page book only to discover that you can summarize it with two sentences.

If that's you, Self-Disciplined Producer is for you. Written with high performers in mind, it's a concise guide covering the most effective techniques to build self-control, improve your productivity and deliver consistent results day in, and day out. In about an hour and a half of reading you'll discover:

- a confusingly simple strategy of an American novelist and screenwriter that can help you overcome one habit that is most harming your productivity,

- how distractions can make you more eager to get to work,

- three strategies to ensure that you always finish what you started instead of leaving all your projects half-finished,

- five strategies to embrace delayed gratification and become more patient with the process so that you won't give up prematurely,

- a fun mental exercise to help you identify the most important task and reduce time spent on less meaningful activities,

- a principle developed in the 14th century by an English philosopher that can help you simplify your workday and become more productive,

- a law humorously invented by a British naval historian that can help you perform your most important tasks in half the time usually needed to get them done,

- six methods to recharge for higher productivity—because without a proper rest protocol you'll be unlikely to ever operate at an optimal level.

The author of Self-Disciplined Producer has been using these techniques to help him publish sixteen books, create four video courses with over 25,000 enrolled students in total, and translate his books into ten languages—all in the span of two years and a half.

He watched in bewilderment as a small pro-Tibet protest was overrun by thousands of angry Chinese students. Where did they come from? Why were they so aggressive? And what gave them the right to shut down others exercising their democratic right to protest? The authorities did nothing about it, and what he saw stayed with him.
 
In 2016 it was revealed that wealthy Chinese businessmen linked to the Chinese Communist Party had become the largest donors to both major political parties. Hamilton realised something big was happening, and decided to investigate the Chinese government’s influence in Australia. What he found shocked him.
 
From politics to culture, real estate to agriculture, universities to unions, and even in our primary schools, he uncovered compelling evidence of the Chinese Communist Party’s infiltration of Australia. Sophisticated influence operations target Australia’s elites, and parts of the large Chinese-Australian diaspora have been mobilised to buy access to politicians, limit academic freedom, intimidate critics, collect information for Chinese intelligence agencies, and protest in the streets against Australian government policy. It’s no exaggeration to say the Chinese Communist Party and Australian democracy are on a collision course. The CCP is determined to win, while Australia looks the other way.
 
Thoroughly researched and powerfully argued, Silent Invasion is a sobering examination of the mounting threats to democratic freedoms Australians have for too long taken for granted. Yes, China is important to our economic prosperity; but, Hamilton asks, how much is our sovereignty as a nation worth?

‘Anyone keen to understand how China draws other countries into its sphere of influence should start with Silent Invasion. This is an important book for the future of Australia. But tug on the threads of China’s influence networks in Australia and its global network of influence operations starts to unravel.’ –Professor John Fitzgerald, author of Big White Lie: Chinese Australians in White Australia"

Many business owners are frustrated because they feel invisible in a crowded marketplace. They know they are better than their competitors, but when they focus on that fact, they get little in return. That's because, to customers, better is not actually better. Different is better. And those who market differently, win.

In his new marketing book, Mike Michalowicz offers a proven, no-bullsh*t method to position your business, service, or brand to get noticed, attract the best prospects, and convert those opportunities into sales. Told with the same humor and straight-talk that's gained Michalowicz an army of ardent followers, with actionable insights drawn from stories of real life entrepreneurs, this book lays out a simple, doable system based on three critical questions every entrepreneur and business owner must ask about their marketing:
1. Does it differentiate?
2. Does it attract?
3. Does it direct?

Get Different is a game-changer for everyone who struggles to grow because their brand, message, product or service doesn't stand out and connect with customers--the long-anticipated answer to the defining business challenge of our time."

 Byłam nieposłusznym dzieckiem, nieposłuszną kochanką i wojowniczą projektantką, prawdziwym Lucyferem... Napisano o niej wiele książek, powiedziano wiele prawd, półprawd i kłamstw. W tej Coco Chanel sama opowiada o własnym życiu oraz o micie, który zrósł się z nią jak idealnie skrojona garsonka. Zabiera nas w świat smutnego dzieciństwa u znienawidzonych ciotek w Owernii, do Deauville 1914 roku, gdzie ze swetrów stajennych i treningowych trykotów szyje pierwsze dżerseje dla kurortowych elegantek, na gwarne spotkania przy rue Cambon, których stałymi bywalcami są Picasso, Cocteau, Cendrars, Satie, Braque i Lipschitz, uchyla drzwi do swojej pracowni, opowiada o wieloletnich przyjaźniach z Misią Sert, Diagilewem oraz Strawińskim, a także o jedynym mężczyźnie, którego kochała – Angliku, Boyu Capelu... W tym świecie artystów, milionerów i bezlitosnych rywali życie mademoiselle Chanel  było jak bajka o spełnionym marzeniu, a czasem jak koszmar na jawie. Mawiała, że życie dyktatorki to sukces i samotność, że trzeba mieć „kruchość stali”, by przetrwać...

 Każdy z nas ma swoją legendę, głupią i cudowną. Moja legenda, nad którą współpracowali Paryż i prowincja, imbecyle i artyści, poeci i socjeta, jest jednocześnie tak zróżnicowana, tak złożona, tak pobieżna i tak skomplikowana, że się w niej gubię. Nie tylko wykoślawia mój wizerunek, ale nadaje mi inną twarz; kiedy chcę się w niej rozpoznać, pozostaje mi tylko myślenie o wspomnianej dumie, która jest moją skazą i cnotą. Moja legenda opiera się na dwóch niezniszczalnych filarach: pierwszy, to że pojawiłam się nie wiadomo skąd: z music-hallu, z opery albo z burdelu; żałuję; to byłoby zabawniejsze; druga, to że jestem żeńską wersją króla Midasa. Życie legendy jest trudniejsze niż życie jej podmiotu; rzeczywistość jest smutna i zawsze będziemy woleli od niej tego pięknego pasożyta, jakim jest wyobraźnia. Niech moja legenda idzie swoją drogą, życzę jej długiego i dobrego życia!

renowned playwright William Shakespeare about two teenage ""star-cross'd lovers"" 
whose untimely deaths ultimately unite their feuding households. The play has 
been highly praised by literary critics for its language and dramatic effect. It 
was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with 
Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Its influence is 
still seen today, with the two main characters being widely represented as 
archetypal young lovers.

Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching 
back to Ancient Greece. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into 
verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 
1562, and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 
1582. Brooke and Painter were Shakespeare's chief sources of inspiration for 
Romeo and Juliet. He borrowed heavily from both, but developed minor 
characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris, in order to expand the plot. 
Believed to be written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a 
quarto version in 1597. This text was of poor quality, and later editions 
corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original text.

Shakespeare's use of dramatic structure, especially his expansion of minor 
characters and use of subplots to embellish the story, has been praised as an 
early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to 
different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. 
Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet form over time. Characters 
frequently compare love and death and allude to the role of fate.

Since its original publication, Romeo and Juliet has been adapted 
numerous times in stage, film, musical and operatic forms. During the 
Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David 
Garrick's 18th century version, which continued to be performed on and into the 
Victorian era, also modified several scenes, removing material then considered 
indecent. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, 
restored the original text, and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 
version kept very close to Shakespeare's text, and used Elizabethan costumes and 
staging to enhance the drama.

Writing in their trademark witty, fast-paced style, advertising gurus Ries and Trout explain how to:

• Make and position an industry leader so that its name and message wheedles its way into the collective subconscious of your market-and stays there

• Position a follower so that it can occupy a niche not claimed by the leader

• Avoid letting a second product ride on the coattails of an established one.

Positioning also shows you how to:

• Use leading ad agency techniques to capture the biggest market share and become a household name

• Build your strategy around your competition's weaknesses

• Reposition a strong competitor and create a weak spot

• Use your present position to its best advantage

• Choose the best name for your product

• Determine when-and why-less is more

• Analyze recent trends that affect your positioning.

Ries and Trout provide many valuable case histories and penetrating analyses of some of the most phenomenal successes and failures in advertising history. Revised to reflect significant developments in the five years since its original publication, Positioning is required reading for anyone in business today."

The word ""entrepreneur"" is today's favorite buzzword, and any aspiring business owner has likely encountered an overwhelming number of so-called ""easy paths to success.""   

The truth is that building a real, profitable, sustainable business requires thousands of hours of commitment, grit, and hard work. It's no wonder why more than half of new businesses close within six years of opening, and fewer than 5 percent will ever earn more than $1 million annually. 12 Months to $1 Million condenses the startup phase into one fast-paced year that has helped hundreds of new entrepreneurs hit the million-dollar level by using an exclusive and foolproof formula.   

By cutting out the noise and providing a clear and proven plan, this roadmap helps even brand-new entrepreneurs make decisions quickly, get their product up for sale, and launch it to a crowd that is ready and waiting to buy.   

This one-year plan will guide you through the three stages to your first $1 million:  

   • The Grind (Months 0-4): This step-by-step plan will help you identify a winning product idea, target customers that are guaranteed to buy, secure funding, and take your first sale within your first four months.   
   • The Growth (Months 5 - 8): Once you're in business, you will discover how to use cheap and effective advertising strategies to get your product to at least 25 sales per day, so you can prove you have a profitable business.   
   • The Gold (Months 9-12): It's time to establish series of products available for sale, until you are averaging at least 100 sales per day, getting you closer to the million-dollar mark every single day.  

Through his training sessions at Capitalism.com, Ryan Daniel Moran has helped new and experienced entrepreneurs launch scalable and sustainable online businesses. He's seen more than 100 entrepreneurs cross the seven-figure barrier, many of whom go on to sell their businesses.

Tired of sleepwalking through a mediocre life bribed by mindless video-gaming, redemptive weekends, and a scant paycheck from a soul-suffocating job?  Welcome to the SCRIPTED club— where membership is neither perceived or consented.


The fact is, ever since you’ve been old enough to sit obediently in a classroom, you have been culturally engineered for servitude, unwittingly enslaved into a Machiavellian system where illusionary rules go unchallenged, sanctified traditions go unquestioned, and lifelong dreams go unfulfilled. As a result, your life is hijacked and marginalized into debt, despair, and dependence. Life's death sentence becomes the daily curse of the trivial and mundane. Fun fades. Dreams die. Don't let life's consolation prize become a car and a weekend.


Recapture what is yours and make a revolutionary repossession of life-and-liberty through the pursuit of entrepreneurship. A paradigm shift isn't needed—the damn paradigm needs to be thrown-out altogether.


The truth is, if you blindly follow conventional wisdom pushed by conventional people living conventional lives, can you expect to be anything but conventional? Rewrite life’s script: ditch the job, give Wall Street the bird, and escape the insanity of trading your life away for a paycheck and an elderly promise called retirement. UNSCRIPT today and start leading life— instead of life leading you."

One of the sector’s most important tasks then is to provide food of sufficient quantity and quality to feed and nourish the world’s population sustainably so that all people can lead healthy, productive lives. Achieving this goal will require closer collaboration across the sectors of agriculture, nutrition, and health, which have long operated in separate spheres with little recognition of how their actions affect each other. It is time for agriculture, nutrition, and health to join forces in pursuit of the common goal of improving human well-being.  

 

In Reshaping Agriculture for Nutrition and Health, leading experts, practitioners, and policymakers explore the links among agriculture, nutrition, and health and identify ways to strengthen related policies and programs. The chapters in this book were originally commissioned as background papers or policy briefs for the conference “Leveraging Agriculture for Improving Nutrition and Health,” facilitated by the International Food Policy Research Institute’s 2020 Vision Initiative in New Delhi, India, in February 2011."

“If you want the chance to turn your startup into the next Google or Twitter, then read this trenchant guide from someone who played key roles in the growth of these companies.”

—Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and New York Times No. 1 bestselling author



Global technology executive, serial entrepreneur, and angel investor Elad Gil has worked with high-growth tech companies including Airbnb, Twitter, Google, Stripe, and Square as they’ve grown from small companies to global enterprises.



Across all of these breakout companies, Gil has identified a set of common patterns and has created an accessible playbook, which he has now codified in High Growth Handbook. In this definitive guide, Gil covers key topics, including:

 • the role of the CEO 

 • managing a board 

 • recruiting and overseeing an executive team 

 • mergers and acquisitions 

 • initial public offerings 

 • late-stage funding 



Informed by interviews with some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley, including Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), Marc Andreessen (Andreessen Horowitz), and Aaron Levie (Box), High Growth Handbook presents crystal-clear guidance for navigating the most complex challenges that confront leaders and operators in high-growth startups.



Praise for High Growth Handbook:

“Elad jam-packs every useful lesson about building and scaling companies into a single, digestible book. My only gripe is that he didn’t write this when we were in the early days of Box, as it would have saved my ass countless times.”

—Aaron Levie, cofounder and CEO of Box



“Elad eschews trite management aphorisms in favor of pragmatic and straight-shooting insights on complex topics, like managing a board of directors, executing functional reorganizations with as little trauma as possible, and everything in between.”

—Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter and serial entrepreneur



“Elad first invested in Airbnb when we had fewer than 10 people, and he provided early advice on scaling the company. This book shares these learnings for the next generation of entrepreneurs.”

—Nathan Blecharczyk, cofounder of Airbnb, chief strategy officer and chairman of Airbnb China



“Armed with observations gathered scaling some of the most successful and important companies in Silicon Valley, Elad has no-nonsense, highly applicable advice for any operator transitioning a company from the proverbial garage to the next stage, and beyond.”

—Max Levchin, cofounder and CEO of Affirm, cofounder and CTO of PayPal



“Elad is one of the most experienced operators in Silicon Valley, having seen numerous companies hit their inflection point. His advice has been key for Coinbase as we go through hypergrowth, from hiring executives to improving M&A.”

—Brian Armstrong, cofounder and CEO of Coinbase



“Elad is one of the best-connected and well-respected early-stage investors in the Valley—he invested in Minted when we had fewer than 50 employees, and his advice was critical to us in growing our business to where we are now, in the low hundreds of millions in sales. In his book, he crystallizes all of these learnings for the next generation of companies.”

—Mariam Naficy, cofounder and CEO of Minted"

Written by Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich is the result of more than 500 interviews of America’s wealthiest and most successful business owners in the early part of the 20th century.  It took Hill 25 years to compile, research and ultimately create Think and Grow Rich, and it was Andrew Carnegie who gave Hill the assignment of creating this masterpiece.
 
Think and Grow Rich reveals the “13 steps to riches” that Hill identified in the extensive interviews he completed, and lays a plan of action out that anyone can follow to create success and prosperity in their life.
 
You’ll enjoy Hill’s original work in this updated and revised version, which includes an additional free bonus of the special report, “Get More Business, Get More Life!”  In this ground-breaking work, you’ll learn why most entrepreneurs are exhausted and on the path to failure – and what to do about it."

A “fascinating” (Thomas L. Friedman, New York Times) look at how digital technology is transforming our work and our lives.

In recent years, Google’s autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles on American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies—with hardware, software, and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human.

In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives.

Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar.

Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape.

A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age alters how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress."

If you want to win, you must keep going.  Your paradigms may be masked in complacency, fear, worry, anxiety, insecurities, self-doubt, mental hurry and self-loathing—the result is keeping you STUCK....locked in a box and starved of your dreams and ambitions.

To change your life—you MUST change your paradigm.  The change is not easy, but it's worth it, and the results are lasting.  Bob Proctor will show you his proven methods for doing so. This book will synthesize his decades of study, application, and teaching to:

•	Explain what paradigms are and how they guide every move you make

•	Teach you how to identify your paradigms

•	Show you how to make your own Paradigm Shift

•	Help you transform your finances, health and lifestyle when you change your paradigm 

•	Guide you on how to replace a paradigm that doesn't serve you well with a new one that frees you to create the life you really want

Bob will break through the myth many people have about success—that long hours and hard work are sufficient to achieve lasting success.  Because without changing your paradigm, no amount of hard work and long work hours will make a measurable, lasting difference in your success.

Once you go through Bob Proctor's Paradigm Shift Process, you will expose yourself to a brand new world of power, possibility and promise."

Predict the future? Give incredible demonstrations that would strike awe into any audience?

In Mind - will give you this ability – guaranteed.

With the popularity of the excellent American crime drama “The Mentalist” there has been a resurgence of interest in what may be termed “tricks of the mind”. Patrick Jane is a mentalist who works for the California Bureau of Investigation. Week in and week out he solves murders using his techniques of mentalism.

In Mind will teach you the amazing techniques of mentalism.

Do you want to be a mentalist?

Mentalism or Mind Reading is the most exciting performing art. Once you dazzle your friends, family and acquaintances with a series of devastating seemingly psychic feats – they will forever hound you until you agree to give an encore. Wherever you go you will be pursued, pested and plagued by people who yearn to see you perform. It will change your life forever.

EVERY ROUTINE IN THIS BOOK WILL ALSO BE SHOWN ON VIDEO WITH AN ONLINE LINK– so as well as reading this revolutionary material – you will also have access to live performances and explanations. In essence – you are getting a free DVD!

The term “psychological magic” has also become quite popular in recent years, perhaps reflecting a style of presentation in which results are achieved through the use of psychological techniques, rather than via a magician’s trickery. Mentalist Derren Brown has stated on his TV show that results are obtained through a combination of “magicians’ techniques, showmanship, misdirection and psychology”. This is undoubtedly true, but the implication that these performers actually use more psychology than trickery (as opposed to say a children’s magician or a comedy magician) is most definitely not true. All magical performers use these elements in some combination or another. The difference is that in mentalism it is implied and presented in a way - that psychology is the main methodology.

In all the techniques and routines throughout this book you will convince people that you have an ability to read faces like a book. You will convince them that every mannerism – every twitch, blink, smile frown, every eye movement – every expression – gives you an insight into their minds. You will also ask them to repeat some “keywords” which will also give you an insight into their thoughts. While performing you will keep these two concepts uppermost – FACBOOK and KEYWORDS. This will make your role as mentalist believable. You never claim to be “psychic” – you claim to be intuitive. Every face is like a book – and you have spent years developing this facebook technique.

So I offer you something rather unique –In Mind - How to be a Mentalist. Prepare to learn some of the most powerful and closely guarded secrets in mentalism.

 Nie spodziewajcie się fabularnej konsekwencji ani dyscypliny opowiadania. 


 Wraz ze znanym autorem tekstów, kompozytorem i gitarzystą Andrzejem Sikorowskim udajemy się w podróż po jego życiu i twórczości, a wstępem lub puentą każdej opowieści jest tekst piosenki.


 Lider grupy Pod Budą, autor słynnych przebojów takich jak Bardzo smutna piosenka retro, Ballada o ciotce Matyldzie czy Nie przenoście nam stolicy do Krakowa opowiada o swoim dzieciństwie i fascynacji sportem, o studiach i początkach muzykowania, o rodzinie, karierze, podróżach z gitarą i bez niej, ulubionych miejscach – Krakowie, Zakopanem, Grecji, wreszcie o ukochanych zwierzakach i instrumentach.


 Mam słabość do ludzi bez względu na ich poglądy i przekonania.


 Na kartach książki odnajdziemy portrety wielu znakomitych postaci, które artysta spotkał na swojej drodze, między innymi artystów: Anny Szałapak, Zbigniewa Wodeckiego, Marka Grechuty, Piotra Skrzyneckiego, Grzegorza Turnaua czy Andrzeja Zauchy. Nie zabraknie również związanych z nimi anegdot.


 Zawsze starałem się pisać z morałem, przesłaniem, wnioskiem.


 Twórczość muzyczna od samego początku jest dla Andrzeja Sikorowskiego sposobem, w jaki artysta dzieli się z odbiorcą swoimi przemyśleniami; podobnie jest i tutaj: opowieści, anegdoty i wspomnienia są tu często punktem wyjścia do mądrej refleksji na temat minionego i współczesnego świata."

Our work lives revolve around effective communication. It is essential for cultivating trust and team collaboration, as well as strengthening our motivation and wellbeing at work. And with teams experiencing more anxiety, stress, and burnout than ever before, strong communication skills have never been more essential.

The key to this clear and effective communication begins with understanding our own personal communication styles. Bringing our whole and authentic selves to work improves relationships and teamwork. The better we understand what drives us, how we impact others, and how our wellbeing impacts our communication, the faster we can close communication gaps to build healthy, successful, and satisfying work lives and more intentional careers.

Drawing on more than a decade of original research on communication tendencies, as well as proven mindfulness and habit-formation techniques, Maryanne O’Brien has developed a proprietary model of communication styles: Expressive, Reserved, Direct, or Harmonious.

In The Elevated Communicator you will find:
 -A self-assessment to discover your own personal style
 -An in-depth style profile to strengthen self-awareness and help you play to your style’s strengths
 -The connection between emotional health and communication patterns
 -Strategies to manage your communication style under stress
 -Practices to improve your well-being and reduce conflict
 -Ways to care for your communication style and improve your wellbeing
 -Methods to flex toward other styles to communicate more effectively with people
 -Advice on building healthy, trusted, and productive working relationships

After the first part of the season provided an emotional ending to the Doctor's travels with his friends Amy and Rory, Steven Moffat presented an innovative and intriguing new mystery, as the Doctor puzzled over the “woman twice dead” that is Clara Oswald, who had the most spectacular introduction(s) of any companion. This series was the most demanding yet for Moffat; no other Doctor Who showrunner had previously faced an assignment like writing a series finale, an anniversary story, and a combined Christmas Special/Doctor finale in quick succession. We are with Moffat every step of the way as he rises to this unique challenge.
The format of this book is the same as our previous Doctor Who guides. Steven Cooper has written excellent detailed analyses of each episode, which Slant Magazine published online in their House Next Door blog soon after each episode was broadcast. In this way, Steven’s reviews provide an invaluable record of how a long-standing fan reacted to each twist of the plot as it occurred. House Next Door published Steven’s 2013 episode reviews in abridged form; he then expanded upon his analyses, so this book contains far more of his insights than those published online. Kevin Mahoney then follows Steven’s analyses with his reviews, which he wrote from the perspective of having watched the entire series. This enabled him to gauge exactly how Steven Moffat had put this season together, and to assess the success of his various hoodwinks and sleights of hand.
In this series, Steven Moffat was just as ambitious as ever - perhaps too ambitious at times, when the scripting became uneven or the production team was not able to realize an episode as well as they might have done. Despite this, there were several episodes that rank among the best of the show's achievements, which we applaud in this celebration of Doctor Who's 50th Anniversary."

Our education promotes the left-brain approach as being 'serious' and reliable, and it therefore tends to predominate in our work activities, to the exclusion of our intuitive, creative faculties.
However, the creative qualities that give birth to organizations are the most powerful ones to use to sustain and grow it. Every single aspect of business—relationship dynamics, product development, operational processes, management practices, marketing, emotional/mental health, and customer relations—work better where there is a vibrant creative culture."

The core of what is vital to effective time management is: decision, discipline, and determination. And in this fully revised and updated edition, Tracy adds two new chapters. The first explains how you can use technology to remind yourself of what is most important and protect yourself from what is least important.

While it is possible to make great long-term returns investing in one stock, it is equally possible to lose everything.

Taking a 50% risk with your money is more akin to gambling than any kind of value investing and, as value investors, we dislike risk intensely. We want to keep our capital as safe as possible, while it grows as much as possible.

The key to this is dividing our money across asset classes of differing risk; market cap, industry, geography and currency. The lower risk instruments will offer safety and stability but also low returns, counter balancing the higher risks associated with equities. This takes advantage of market peaks and troughs to generate a positive risk-return ratio.

But which classes should you choose, how much should you assign to each class and where exactly should you invest?

This eBook is the first of two. Here in Part One, we detail STRIDE’s theory of asset allocation. In the second, we will demonstrate how we practically apply this model to ensure effective, day-to-day, portfolio management.

These books do not constitute financial advice. The risk-return wheel and STRIDE asset allocation model are working really well for us: we simply want to share what we’ve learned. Your specific asset allocation will start with your circumstances, lifestyle requirements and risk profile. It is around these three things that investors should tailor their personal asset allocation strategy, researching as many models as they wish.

For us, risk is particularly important. We’ve discovered that attitude to risk is pivotal and decisive in how we choose to invest.

Are you a cautious, mindful, confident or bold investor?

Your conclusion might surprise you. It doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with age or experience - although it is wise to consider both.

Using our asset allocation model, we can demonstrate how it is possible for a confident investor to achieve 11% annualised returns with a very low risk profile. For the cautious or mindful, this is more like 5 - 8%. Bold investors who can stomach volatility and are committed to almost daily input, can aim for 20% returns per annum.
There is no such thing as a 100% safe investment portfolio. The markets are subject to various unpredictable forces that affect levels of risk: trends, war, drought, economic dips or technological evolution, to name a few. However none of these matter in the long term.

Using STRIDE’s asset allocation model, investing in undervalued, fundamentally strong businesses and taking a long-term approach, investors of every profile are achieving great returns with significantly reduced risk.

And we are going to show you how."

Particularly in an era of historically high wage and income inequality, many in the workforce depend on full employment labor markets, and the bargaining power it provides, to secure a fair share of the economy's growth. For the bottom third or even half of the wage distribution, high levels of employment are a necessary condition for improving wages, higher incomes, and better working conditions.

This book is a follow-up to a book written a decade ago by the authors, The Benefits of Full Employment (Economic Policy Institute, 2003). It builds on the evidence presented in that book, showing that real wage growth for workers in the bottom half of the income scale is highly dependent on the overall rate of unemployment. In the late 1990s, when the United States saw its first sustained period of low unemployment in more than a quarter century, workers at the middle and bottom of the wage distribution were able to secure substantial gains in real wages. When unemployment rose in the 2001 recession, and again following the collapse of the housing bubble, most workers no longer had the bargaining power to share in the benefits of growth. The book also documents another critical yet often overlooked side effect of full employment: improved fiscal conditions (without mindless budget policies like the current sequestration). Finally, in this volume, unlike the earlier one, the authors present a broad set of policies designed to boost growth and get the unemployment rate down to a level where far more workers have a fighting chance of getting ahead."

Did you know that only 22% of workers are confident they will have enough money in retirement? How about that 45% of Americans have saved NOTHING for retirement? These are facts.

If you’re tired of an uncertain future for you and your family, How to Make Your Money Last will guide you to comfortable living.

Four, it means less protection and support for your family and loved ones. Go ahead and read that list again, and ask yourself if that is the life you want to live and be remembered by. 

Getting laid off while living paycheck-to-paycheck creates an unstable and stressful home. How will you put food on the table? How will you keep a roof over your head? How will you pay for your transportation? These are worries that you do not need to have.

So what separates consulting from the rest?


One of the best ways to judge a business model is on the following criteria:


Effort: how much work and time does it take to operate?

Profit: how efficient is monetization of the business?

Fragility: how easily is it disrupted by competitors, economic recessions and other external factors?


These three pillars give you a strong gauge on not only how well a business model will perform… but how long it will perform.


Score any of the most popular models being pushed today – whether course creation, ecom, dropshipping or freelancing – and you’ll find they each fall short in at least one area.


But there’s ONE model unlike the rest. This little thing called “consulting.”


When you set up a consulting business correctly – it shines in all three criteria.


You only need to work as much as you want to work. The margins are high. And you can easily weather any storm.


After building his own consulting business, and helping countless clients do same, Taylor Welch is finally pulling back the curtain on how you can do it too.


Taylor’s main consultancy, Traffic & Funnels, services tens of thousands of customers and clients each year, many of whom are brand new to consulting. Including everyone from...


• Freelancers and agency owners looking to decrease the “done for you” or “one-on-one” work

• Health & medical practitioners wanting to use their expertise in new ways

• Retired athletes trying to create new revenue streams in fields they care about

• Moms and dads who want to build part time income without sacrificing pace of life

• Coaches who are tired of the 9-5 grind and want life & wealth on their terms

• Existing consultants who want to learn what T&F clients are doing differently to scale so successfully


These are people from all over the world, incredibly diverse in age, talent, backgrounds and skillsets.


But that’s what’s so great about consulting – it can work for almost anyone. And in this book, Taylor hands you the roadmap.


The Consultant Next Door guides you through everything from picking your niche, crafting your offer and setting your price… 


To getting in front of the right people, getting them on the phone, and then enrolling them as new clients…


And then how to scale things up on your own terms so you can spend plenty of time on what’s most important to you outside of your work. After all, there’s no point making so much money if it’s at the expense of enjoying your life, right?


The process is predictable, and it’s all laid out for you inside this book.


So are you ready to find out what’s possible as a highly-sought-after consultant?"

It’s a 60 Minutes story on 60 Minutes itself. 

When producer Ira Rosen walked into the 60 Minutes offices in June 1980, he knew he was about to enter television history. His career catapulted him to the heights of TV journalism, breaking some of the most important stories in TV news. But behind the scenes was a war room of clashing producers, anchors, and the most formidable 60 Minutes figure: legendary correspondent Mike Wallace.

Based on decades of access and experience, Ira Rosen takes readers behind closed doors to offer an incisive look at the show that invented TV investigative journalism. With surprising humor, charm, and an eye for colorful detail, Rosen delivers an authoritative account of the unforgettable personalities that battled for prestige, credit, and the desire to scoop everyone else in the game. As Mike Wallace’s top producer, Rosen reveals the interview secrets that made Wallace’s work legendary, and the flaring temper that made him infamous. Later, as senior producer of ABC News Primetime Live and 20/20, Rosen exposes the competitive environment among famous colleagues like Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walters, and the power plays between correspondents Chris Wallace, Anderson Cooper, and Chris Cuomo. 

A master class in how TV news is made, Rosen shows readers how 60 Minutes puts together a story when sources are explosive, unreliable, and even dangerous. From unearthing shocking revelations from inside the Trump White House, to an outrageous proposition from Ghislaine Maxwell, to interviewing gangsters Joe Bonanno and John Gotti Jr., Ira Rosen was behind the scenes of 60 Minutes' most sensational stories.

Highly entertaining, dishy, and unforgettable, Ticking Clock is a never-before-told account of the most successful news show in American history."

Mill had a very extraordinary, strenuous education, overseen by his ambitious father James, who believed that one becomes improved via education and, once educated, that is the end of the matter. John Mill was reading Greek at age three and Latin at the age of eight. He was at heart always reform-minded, however, and his more mature views allowed that people might come to realize how best to reform, remake, and improve themselves. In fact, reform-mindedness is a major theme in Mill’s life. Among the many liberal causes associated with him are the defense of the abolition of slavery, repeal of the Corn Laws, extension of the franchise and property rights to women, reform of Irish property arrangements, and the question of birth control.

In the summer of 1830, Mill met and fell headlong in love with the already married Harriet Taylor and began an intense and prolonged relationship with her. The repercussions of his friendship with and eventual marriage to Harriet were profound—and costly—and included isolation from family and friends. The experience formed the backdrop to his strong denunciation in On Liberty of the oppression associated with public opinion. 

Harriet’s influence on Mill’s work was significant. Beginning in 1846 in a newspaper article and then recurring frequently thereafter, Mill attributed much of his work as a “joint production” with Taylor. In 1861, Mill completed one of his and Harriet’s most influential works, The Subjection of Women, on which he had collaborated closely with Harriet until her sudden death in 1858. Published in 1869, it was filled with many ideas ahead of their time.

In 1865, well after Harriet’s death, Mill became a member of Parliament. By that point, he had gained a great deal of fame as a logician, philosopher, and political economist. Mill’s time in Parliament was relatively brief but his influence did not dwindle in retirement. He spent many of his remaining years in France, living in Avignon until his death in 1873."

 The power of glitzy advertising and elaborate marketing campaigns is on the wane; word- of-mouth referrals are what drive business today. People trust the recommendation of a friend, family member, colleague, or even stranger with similar tastes over anything thrust at them by a faceless company. 

 Most business owners believe that whether customers refer them is entirely out of their hands. But science shows that people can't help recommending products and services to their friends-it's an instinct wired deep in the brain. And smart businesses can tap into that hardwired desire. 

 Marketing expert John Jantsch offers practical techniques for harnessing the power of referrals to ensure a steady flow of new customers. Keep those customers happy, and they will refer your business to even more customers. Some of Jantsch's strategies include: 

 -Talk with your customers, not at them. Thanks to social networking sites, companies of any size have the opportunity to engage with their customers on their home turf as never before-but the key is listening. 

 -The sales team is the most important part of your marketing team. Salespeople are the company's main link to customers, who are the main source of referrals. Getting them on board with your referral strategy is critical. 

 -Educate your customers. Referrals are only helpful if they're given to the right people. Educate your customers about whom they should be talking to. 

 The secret to generating referrals lies in understanding the ""Customer Referral Cycle""-the  way customers refer others to your company who, in turn, generate even more referrals. Businesses can ensure a healthy referral cycle by moving customers and prospects along the path of Know, Like, Trust, Try, Buy, Repeat, and Refer.

To hear is about receiving input. Listening gives meaning to that input. Yet, many people take listening for granted, treating it as a passive activity rather than a skill that you actively build. If you want to communicate better, it may be time to do a re-frame on what it means to really listen to someone.

You’ll never be a good listener if you have nothing to learn. You can’t be influenced to see things differently if you don’t believe there’s anything to learn from another person….or from the team. When people engage with you in conversation, do they experience someone who is open or closed? Helpful or unhelpful? If your goal is to be a better teammate, you don’t want to leave these questions to chance.

Think about active listening as switching between channels on a television, where you listen with a different ear depending on what’s required in the conversation. Your ability to switch channels is especially helpful when someone at work asks you to help them think through something difficult or complex. To be a better teammate, you should ask this question more frequently: How do you want me to listen?

There are six ways to listen more effectively in a conversation:

1. Listening with Compassion. When a person asks you to listen, don’t assume that they need you to do anything, or fix anything for them. Sometimes all they really want is for you to understand what an experience has been like for them, especially something difficult. Put simply, they just want you to listen to how they feel.

2. Listening to Reflect. When you listen to reflect, you are serving as a mirror to the person – to play the person’s words back to them, so they can hear it in a way that you’re hearing it. You sound pretty angry – is that how you really feel about it? When you listen to reflect, it helps the person to re-calibrate around both the message and underlying sentiment.

3. Listening for Assumptions. This listening style requires you to listen intently because your goal is to pull out every assumption that you think might be worth testing. An example of listening for assumptions would be: You’re saying that our older customers won’t mind the shift to younger styles – is that a fair assumption? Questions like this will slow the conversation down, but may save the team months of clean-up if an assumption is faulty.

4. Listening as the Contrarian. This style gives you permission to listen as the opposition – and to point out all the holes you hear in their argument. This listening style is especially helpful if the team tends to have safe and cautious conversations, or rushes to decisions without vetting all possible risks. The contrarian can bring out things that might otherwise go unspoken.

5. Listening for Balance. Balance comes in many forms and shapes. There are countless polarities that often get skewed in one direction or the other. It helps if someone on the team plays an active role to make sure that there is no gaping hole caused by some view point that is missing. Listening for balance is especially helpful if a person is rigidly locked onto a position, or the team is full of people who think in one particular way.

6. Listening for the System. Sometimes on a team, people are myopic around their own issues and no one listens to hear how the whole system is impacted. It undermines performance when they take their collective eye off the bigger picture. This listening style is especially important when people who are not involved in the conversation will still be affected by the decision.

When results really do matter to a team, they work hard to have high quality conversations. That can’t happen if everyone is talking and no one is listening. This book will make it easier to ask the question: How do you want me to listen? That can truly make the difference between good and great."

ほとんどの人が目を付けていない投資法を解禁。

これで周りの投資家に差をつけよう!


「一生懸命働いているけど、給与が伸びない」 

「残業が禁止されて、収入が減ってしまった」 


サラリーマンにとって、収入の問題は頭の痛い問題です。 

特に、近年はサラリーマンの平均年収も減少しており、なかなか希望を見いだすことができません。 


それに追い打ちをかけるかのように、国は残業に対して厳しく規制を始めました。 

これまで、あてにしていた残業代が出ないことで、困っている方も多いのではないでしょうか。 


時代は大きく変わりつつあります。 

終身雇用・年功序列に守られたサラリーマンも、その恩恵はほとんど受けられなくなりつつあります。 

安定を求めている方にとっては、受難の時代といえるでしょう。 


一方で、2018年からこれまで禁止されていたサラリーマンの副業が解禁されます。 

厚生労働省が定めるモデル就業規則が改正されることで、今後勤め先以外から収入を得る機会が増えるでしょう。 


そんな時代に、あなたはどう行動しますか? 

この本を手に取っているということは、何かやらなければと考えていることでしょう。 


そこで、この本では、あなたにピッタリの副業を紹介します。 

それも、サラリーマンの仕事に差し支えないように行えるものです。 

少額から始めることができて、リスクも少ない、極めて理想的な投資なのですが、日本人で行っている人はまだ少数です。 


私は、これまで投資のプロフェッショナルとして、さまざまな投資を研究、そして精通してきました。 

その中で、もっとも最適といえる投資を発見しました。 

その投資手法を、この本で大公開していきます。 


この情報を手に入れたあなたは、とてもラッキーです。 

まずは、なぜ私が投資を薦めるかというところから、スタートできればと思います。

What sets this international bestseller - with over 410,000 copies sold - apart from all the other retirement books is its holistic approach to the fears, hopes, and dreams that people have about retirement. This one-of-a-kind guide goes way beyond the numbers that is often the main focus of most retirement planning books.<br>

 <br>

The key to creating an active and fulfilling retirement involves a great deal more than having adequate financial resources; it also encompasses all other aspects of life - interesting leisure activities, creative pursuits, physical well-being, mental well-being, great friends, and solid social support.<br>

 <br>

International bestselling author and prosperity life coach Ernie J. Zelinski guides you to:<br>

 <br>

* Gain courage to take early retirement - in fact, the earlier the better.<br>

* Put money in proper perspective so that you don't need a million dollars to retire.<br>

* Generate purpose in your retirement life with meaningful creative pursuits.<br>

* Follow your dreams instead of someone else's.<br>

* Utilize his innovative ""The Get-a-Life Tree"" for choosing retirement activities that resonate with your soul.<br>

* Take charge of your mental, physical, and spiritual health.<br>

* Better envision your retirement goals - including where you want to live.<br>

* Above all, make your retirement years the best time of your life.<br>

 <br>

In short, the retirement wisdom in this book will prove to be much more important than how much money you have saved. ""How to Retire Happy Wild, and Free"" helps readers create an active, satisfying, and happy retirement in a way such that they don't need a million dollars to retire.<br>

 <br>

As a bonus, this ebook edition has a bit more content than the print edition, a few more images, some new inspirational quotations about retirement, several interesting letters from readers of the print edition, as well as links to the retirement resources mentioned in the book.<br>

 <br>

""How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free"" is optimistic, practical, humorous, and provocative AND comprehensively addresses the many issues impacting individuals as they think about their retirement.”<br>

Gentleman Jack tells the story of Anne Lister in the 1830s, a time when Anne Lister powerfully came into her own.

Pennine Pens was delighted to publish Nature’s Domain: Anne Lister and the Landscape of Desire in 2003. This remarkable book has remained in print for sixteen years. So here now for the very first time is a new eBook edition ~ making this influential Anne Lister classic readily available across the world to everyone with a Kindle, iPad or other eBook device.
Anne Lister (1791-1840) was a scholar and traveller, a landowner and lesbian. Her diaries run to over four million words, much of it written in her own secret code & recording in vivid detail her affairs with other women. Anne inherited the Shibden Hall estate in Halifax and, as a member of the landed gentry, had a strong the sense of her dynastic entitlement.
Nature’s Domain tells the dramatic story, previously unknown, of Anne Lister in 1832 ~ eight intense months of her life, from April to New Year’s Eve. In May 1832 aged 41, Anne arrived back home to ancient Shibden Hall, betrayed once again by yet another woman’s marriage plans. Despondent, she knew her romantic youth was over. Almost all her female friends had married and settled. She held melancholy spirits at bay by immersing herself for solitary hours in Shibden’s well-stocked library & planning changes to the estate. She must remodel herself too. Certainly she must find a companion for life.
Then a chance re-acquaintance with neighbouring heiress changed her life ~ forever. Anne Lister focussed all her charismatic charm on deft courtship of this lonely young woman. And Shibden was re-moulded into her ‘landscape of desire’. Here in the ‘moss hut’ she had built, her flattering seduction could unfold ~ all away from prying eyes.

1832 was also a year of tremendous political tumult. The great Reform Act might excluded Anne Lister as a woman from the parliamentary franchise. But her tenants were not. With no secret ballot yet, she became a powerful player, door-stepping voting tenants with determined skill.

This dramatic story, hitherto unknown and never before unpublished, unfolds to New Year’s Eve 1832. It records how Anne Lister’s indomitable will enabled her to mould nature to her own powerful desires. 

Jill Liddington is co-author of One Hand Tied Behind Us (1978) which became a suffrage classic. She is author of Presenting the Past: Anne Lister of Halifax 1791-1840 (1994) and of Female Fortune: the Anne Lister diaries 1833-36 (1998). She is an Honorary Research Fellow at the  University of Leeds, and lives in Mytholmroyd near Halifax."

“The management process through which goods and services move from concept to the customer.” 

It explains marketing as taking the product and selling it to the customer. Though selling is not explicitly stated, it is obvious that selling can be considered part of the marketing function. 

As a marketer, this doesn’t come as a shock. Anyone in the marketing world is brought up to believe the holy grail of their industry is to sell products (at large amounts) as a direct result of their efforts and campaigns. 

Yet as a consumer, this terrifies and repulses me. 

It makes me feel like a number. It’s as if I’m merely another statistic for CMO’s to report to the boss. As if I’m stood with an apple on my head waiting patiently for the most accurate marketer to hit it. 

Surely this is wrong? 

The truth is, times are changing, as they always have done and they always will. And when times change, our mindsets have to change as well. Unfortunately, it seems the majority of marketers haven’t got there yet. 

I see so many of my tribe spout the latest buzzwords about customer engagement, or customer insights. Everyone claims that it should always be about the customer as a person, not a segment or a target market. We’re all unique and our marketing efforts should match that. 

So why has nothing changed? 

If you grill these marketers further, they will eventually concede that they still try the age old techniques, it’s just that they now dress it up as being more personal. They still create a sales funnel and try to cram as many people down it as they can. They still aim to convert. 

These people simply don’t get it. They don’t realise that customers are people, and we should treat them as we’d expect to be treated ourselves. 

This “Golden Rule” has endured since the dawn of man. It’s nothing new. But the marketing industry is too scared or lazy or stupid to embrace it. 

Rather than converting their leads, these marketers need to start converting themselves. Hopefully this book will lead the way."

Intelligent Credit Scoring presents a business-oriented process for the development and implementation of risk prediction scorecards. The credit scorecard is a powerful tool for measuring the risk of individual borrowers,  gauging overall risk exposure and developing analytically driven, risk-adjusted strategies for existing customers. In the past 10 years, hundreds of banks worldwide have brought the process of developing credit scoring models in-house, while ‘credit scores' have become a frequent topic of conversation in many countries where bureau scores are used broadly. In the United States, the ‘FICO' and ‘Vantage' scores continue to be discussed by borrowers hoping to get a better deal from the banks. While knowledge of the statistical processes around building credit scorecards is common, the business context and intelligence that allows you to build better, more robust, and ultimately more intelligent, scorecards is not. As the follow-up to Credit Risk Scorecards, this updated second edition includes new detailed examples, new real-world stories, new diagrams, deeper discussion on topics including WOE curves, the latest trends that expand scorecard functionality and new in-depth analyses in every chapter. Expanded coverage includes new chapters on defining infrastructure for in-house credit scoring, validation, governance, and Big Data. 

Black box scorecard development by isolated teams has resulted in statistically valid, but operationally unacceptable models at times. This book shows you how various personas in a financial institution can work together to create more intelligent scorecards, to avoid disasters, and facilitate better decision making. Key items discussed include: 
Following a clear step by step framework for development, implementation, and beyond Lots of real life tips and hints on how to detect and fix data issues How to realise bigger ROI from credit scoring using internal resources Explore new trends and advances to get more out of the scorecard  
Credit scoring is now a very common tool used by banks, Telcos, and others around the world for loan origination, decisioning, credit limit management, collections management, cross selling, and many other decisions. Intelligent Credit Scoring helps you organise resources, streamline processes, and build more intelligent scorecards that will help achieve better results."

A radical, how-to guide for using exponential technologies, moonshot thinking, and crowd-powered tools, Bold unfolds in three parts. Part One focuses on the exponential technologies that are disrupting today’s Fortune 500 companies and enabling upstart entrepreneurs to go from “I’ve got an idea” to “I run a billion-dollar company” far faster than ever before. The authors provide exceptional insight into the power of 3D printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, networks and sensors, and synthetic biology. Part Two draws on insights from billionaires such as Larry Page, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos and reveals their entrepreneurial secrets. Finally, Bold closes with a look at the best practices that allow anyone to leverage today’s hyper-connected crowd like never before. Here, the authors teach how to design and use incentive competitions, launch million-dollar crowdfunding campaigns to tap into tens of billions of dollars of capital, and finally how to build communities—armies of exponentially enabled individuals willing and able to help today’s entrepreneurs make their boldest dreams come true."

In New York, 1954, a man is dead and the life of another is at stake. A 'guilty' verdict seems a foregone conclusion, but one member of the jury has the will to probe more deeply into the evidence and the courage to confront the ignorance and prejudice of some of his fellow jurors. The conflict that follows is fierce and passionate, cutting straight to the heart of the issues of civil liberties and social justice.


Ideal for the student reader, the accompanying pedagogical notes include elements such as an author chronology; plot summary; suggested further reading; explanatory endnotes; and questions for further study. The introduction discusses in detail the play's origins as a 1954 American television play, Rose's re-working of the piece for the stage, and Lumet's 1957 film version, identifying textual variations between these versions and discussing later significant productions.


The commentary also situates the play in relation to the genre of courtroom drama, as a milestone in the development of televised drama, and as an engagement with questions of American individualism and democracy."

In this renowned book, Everett M. Rogers, professor and chair of the Department of Communication & Journalism at the University of New Mexico, explains how new ideas spread via communication channels over time. Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances—a process which typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people. The fifth edition addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas."

Amid the hundreds of ""how-to"" books out there, there have been very few which attempted to analyze the mysteries of play construction. Lajos Egri's classic, The Art of Dramatic Writing, does just that, with instruction that can be applied equally well to a short story, novel, or screenplay.

Examining a play from the inside out, Egri starts with the heart of any drama: its characters. All good dramatic writing hinges on people and their relationships, which serve to move the story forward and give it life, as well as an understanding of human motives—why people act the way that they do. Using examples from everything from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet to Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, Egri shows how it is essential for the author to have a basic premise—a thesis, demonstrated in terms of human behavior—and to develop the dramatic conflict on the basis of that behavior.

Using Egri's ABCs of premise, character, and conflict, The Art of Dramatic Writing is a direct, jargon-free approach to the problem of achieving truth in writing."

The food price spikes of the years just prior to 2010 and the economic, political, and social dislocations they generated refocused the attention of policymakers and development practitioners on the agricultural sector and food security concerns. But even without those traumatic events, the importance of agriculture for developing countries—and for an adequate functioning of the world economy— cannot be denied. First, although declining over time, primary agriculture still represents important percentages of developing countries’ overall domestic production, exports, and employment. If agroindustrial, transportation, commercial, and other related activities are also counted, then the economic and social importance of agriculture-based sectors increases significantly. Furthermore, large numbers of the world’s poor still live in rural areas and work in agriculture. Through the links via production, trade, employment, and prices, agricultural production is also crucial for national food security. Second, it has been shown that agriculture in developing countries has important growth and employment multipliers for the rest of the economy, and agriculture seems to have larger positive effects in reducing poverty than growth in other sectors. Third, agriculture is not only important for individual developing countries, but it has global significance, considering the large presence of developing countries in world agricultural production and the increasing participation in international trade of those products (these three points will be covered in greater detail in Chapter 1)."

Facebook may still be the world’s most popular social media platform, but Instagram isn’t far behind—and ready to take top honors very soon. In fact, Instagram has passed the one-billion user mark this year - more than twice the number of monthly active Twitter users.
 
Instagram is also a terrific resource for mortgage brokers and loan officers who are looking to gain a larger client base, connect with Realtors for more referral business, and close far more deals this year (and who among us isn't looking for that?!)
 
What will you get out of marketing (correctly) on Instagram?
 
Leads, referrals, and more leads!
 
In fact, 73% of consumers report that their purchase decisions are impacted by a brand's Instagram presence – including when it comes to getting their next home loan.

In summary, this year’s top-producing mortgage lender is starting to take Instagram seriously, today!

Money is employed to restrict output growth through applying international and national controls over issuance of money. Output growth becomes dependent upon availability of money. money is used to play an inflationary role via excessive expansion of money supply to pay interests, taxes, speculative gains and illegal earnings. it looses its reliability as a measure of value and its honesty as a store of value. an alternative closed monetary system based on viewing money as just a valueless medium of exchange introduces a different approach to the theory of money.present financial systems have ghastly impacts on societies. An alternative profit sharing financing system is presented to replace present banking system and financial markets.a financial security system is introduced to sustain all members of society at or above a specified material standard of living and to ensure sufficiency of public revenue to finance public services with no need to borrow money or seek foreign investments. it is presented to replace present public finance system, welfare policies, and redistribution systems.failure of man-made systems to realize prosperity makes it necessary to review the foundations on which present economic systems are based, and to look for an alternative system based on principles set by the Creator of people.The analysis in this book proceeds in five chapters. each chapter introduces a different economic topic; productive activities, financial activities, redistribution system, financing system, and monetary system. while the first two chapters are concerned with the many activities undertaken in relation to wealth, the last three chapters are concerned with the economic system that organizes the ways by which available resources are utilized. each chapter explains how present economic principles are implemented with regard to the subject topic, highlights the pitfalls in economic thinking, and illustrates the related ideological viewpoints of Islam supported by the verses of the holly qur’an and the sayings of the Prophet (pbuh). each of the last three chapters introduces an alternative system based on sharia law.the views expressed here are undoubtedly drastically different from the views of other researchers. However, financial distress is increasing and people will, sooner or later, realize the truth and make concert efforts to gradually embrace an alternative system that would reflect fair economy, and advance the needs of humanity as a whole."

Why is there such a fixation on a few bullet-point highlights of candidates’ résumés, to the point that most applicants are quickly cast aside as “not good enough”? Why is there such unwillingness to get to know what job seekers are all about? What if you could change the rules? What if you could capture the attention of employers who should be hiring you, persuading them to see you on your terms?

Becoming a Rare Find will show you how to approach job hunting in ways that play to your strengths. If you are a natural project manager, then develop a project plan. If you like marketing, build a marketing campaign that centers on reasons why employers should want you. Whatever approach you settle on—and no matter what job you want—you will get a better chance to “show your fire.” You will escape the clutter of job-posting stampedes, where the odds of winning even a barista’s job can be slimmer than the chances of getting into Harvard. You will start finding jobs through the “hidden market,” where they are sometimes never announced, and you will discover the value of small companies with big ambitions. Finally, you will learn how to rearrange your social media profiles so that when great employers look for talent, they will find you."

In each chapter, the contributing photographers demonstrate in a clear, accessible manner how the use of one or more filters can help replicate what they see in front of them at the moment of capture – saving valuable time and, importantly, keeping post-production to a minimum.


The result? More time to spend in the field making images. Each photograph is illustrated with a diagram showing the placement of the selected filters, while the captions explain clearly what the photographer intended to capture – and how the filter helped them achieve their vision.


Inspiring Professionals 2 has been designed from scratch for the screen and is lavishly illustrated with photographs that demonstrate the creative potential of filters around the themes of Buildings, Coast, Handheld and Travel, Mountains, Sky, Snow and Ice, and Water.


The book also features a number of Technical Articles on topics as diverse as understanding colour, composition, stitched panoramas and unconventional uses of an ND grad, making it a must-read for any photographer who is interested in balancing their creativity with technical know-how.


Features the work of Joe Cornish, Mark Denton, Paul Gallagher, John Gravett, Tom Mackie, David Noton, Charlie Waite, Jeremy Walker and David Ward."

It will help hiring managers and recruiters find and hire more top-notch people for any job, from entry-level to senior executive. Using the two-question Performance-based Interview, anyone who is involved in assessing candidates will quickly be more effective and more accurate. 


Just as important, it will help job-seekers find better jobs by giving them an inside view of how most companies look for, assess and hire new employees. Hiring top talent starts by clarifying expectations up front. This has been shown to be the primary reason people perform at peak levels. This book is based on the Performance-based Hiring process Lou Adler introduced in his Amazon bestseller, ""Hire With Your Head"". 


Performance-based Hiring is now used around the world in small and large organizations and companies. However, it is a non-traditional hiring process. Performance-based job descriptions—which we call performance profiles—replace the commonly used skills- and experience-based job descriptions. Instead of emotions, feelings and biases, evidence is used to assess competency and fit within the organization. Rather than weed out people who don’t posses some arbitrary list of prerequisites, compelling career messages are used to excite and attract the best. 


Due to this unconventional but commonsense approach, David Goldstein of Littler Mendelson, the largest labor firm in the U.S., was asked to review Performance-based Hiring and provide a general statement of validity. Here’s his summary: 


""Because the Performance-based Hiring system does differ from traditional recruiting and hiring processes, questions arise as to whether employers can adopt Performance-based Hiring and still comply with the complex array of statutes, regulations, and common law principals that regulate the workplace. The answer is yes.


In particular:


A properly prepared performance profile can identify and document the essential functions of a job better than traditional position descriptions, facilitating the reasonable accommodation of disabilities and making it easier to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.


Even employers that maintain more traditional job descriptions may still use performance profiles or summaries of performance profiles to advertise job openings. Employers are not legally required to post their internal job descriptions when advertising an open position. Nor is there any legal obligation to (or advantage in) posting boring ads.


Focusing on Year 1 and Beyond criteria may open the door to more minority, military, and disabled candidates who have a less 'traditional' mix of experiences, thereby supporting affirmative action or diversity efforts.


Conducting performance-based interviews ensures that the interviews will be structured and properly focused and minimizes the risk of an interviewer inquiring into protected characteristic. Moreover, since the performance-based interviews are conducted pursuant to a common methodology, one is assured that the candidates are being fairly compared.


Performance-based interviewing promotes fair consideration of the different skills and experiences that each candidate has to offer—which is essential to promoting diversity.""


Performance-based Hiring can help companies find and hire the best talent available. On the other hand, understanding how companies make these critical decisions can help job-seekers navigate these tricky waters, the poorly designed hiring processes still in use. But no matter which side of the hiring desk you are on, hiring the right person or getting the right job will increase satisfaction, performance and motivation. All it takes is a little common sense, which surprisingly seems in short abundance in the world of hiring."

BUT I WARN YOU OF THIS: If you are living in a fantasyland hoping for some magical formula to help you quickly pay off your mortgage, don’t bother with this book. There is no quick and easy way. Nothing of great value ever comes quickly and easily.

However, if you have a realistic view of life and would like to pay off your mortgage years before it is due, but can’t wrap your mind around how you might do so, you need this book."

By understanding some basic principles it is possible to give ourselves a fighting chance of success. 


Gerald Weinberg famously said: “No matter what the problem is, it's always a people problem”, so it might make a bit of sense to start looking at some fundamental people problems which are often responsible for thwarting process improvement initiatives or indeed any other kind of organisational change programme.


This e-book takes a different approach to the traditional Do’s and Don’ts by looking at key behaviours of people which are often the real reasons why improvement and change programme fails. If we can understand what dysfunctional behaviours to look for, how to spot them in ourselves and others and how to take steps to prevent them from interfering in our process improvement efforts, then we may be able to eliminate some of the problems which continue to plague us."

“Significant...The book is both instructive and surprisingly moving.” —The New York Times

 Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he’s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business—and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals.

In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.

 In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.

Here, from a man who has been called both “the Steve Jobs of investing” and “the philosopher king of the financial universe” (CIO magazine), is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press."

Throughout history, when a government went off the gold standard, an age of turbulence began.

In 1997, Robert's book Rich Dad Poor Dad stunned readers stating, ""Your house is not an asset."" As howls of protest went up around the world, the book went on to become an international bestseller and the #1 personal finance book of all time.

Rich Dad Poor Dad is not a book on real estate. It is a book about the importance of financial education. Rich Dad Poor Dad was written to prepare you and your loved ones for the financial turbulence Robert's rich dad saw coming.

In 2007, as homes declined in value or were lost to foreclosure, millions of homeowners painfully discovered the wisdom of words of Robert's rich dad. Today we are all aware that a home can be a liability. Today we know a home can go up or down in value. Today, we all know a person can lose money investing in the stock market. Today we all know our money can go down in value and that even savers can be losers.

This is why financial intelligence is more important today than ever before. In a world of financial turbulence, your best asset is financial IQ."

	In the early part of my real estate career I would sit patiently in my office waiting for my next sale to walk in. Well ‘next’ might be exaggerating it a little. A sale would be more appropriate.


	Each night I’d return home and let out a bunch of expletives that would make my dog blush. I was often in a foul mood.


	Then after 10 years of struggle I discovered, developed and implemented a bunch of real estate marketing strategies which I am going reveal in this book that saw my income virtually double in one year. After 2 years of using these real estate lead generation skills my income shot up another 50%.


	The word soon got out that I had discovered a way to make ‘easy’ (no such thing) real estate sales. Real estate referrals became my method of operation. Companies were approaching me to move camps. In fact one company placed me on a $200,000 package to help boost sales. The strategies worked for me and they’ll work for you.


	This book is for real estate sales people, real estate agents or brokers who are totally overwhelmed with the complexities of selling real estate. It’s for agents seething with frustration at their pathetic sales. And it’s also for successful real estate agents wanting to take their real estate career to the next level.

You have two obstacles from making a killing in real estate sales:


	1. You have no idea what business you are REALLY in. Most real estate sales people think that they are in the real estate business to assist people with their real estate buying, selling, leasing or managing needs.While partly ‘true’ unless you have a real estate lead that wants to buy, sell, lease or manage a property through you, you have no business. PERIOD.


	2. A belief that you are ‘Gods’ answer to all things real estate.Let’s face it. Real estate agents are an egotistical bunch. How often do you see advertisements stating “Billy Blogs – No. 1 For XYZ Real Estate” or “Cheryl Champion – Top Real Estate Marketer, Mars Tribune”


	Who gives a toss. The public certainly don’t and nor should you especially if you are a newbie just getting started. With my real estate lead generation tips you’ll soon be the ‘king’ or queen’ of your local area.


	My real estate lead generation strategies are by no means complete. But they are a good start in raising you from the depths of despair to making you the champion agent you so rightly deserve to be. Here’s my appeal to you. Believe in yourself. Believe in your real estate career. Follow my suggestions. Implement those that appeal to you and be consistent. These real estate lead generation strategies take time but they have helped me sell over $400 million of real estate. They will work for you to."

This volume focuses on the bulk of the troubled John Nathan-Turner era, looking at its connections with soap operas, the Falklands, gaming, and more. Every blog post from the Davison and Baker eras has been revised and updated from its original form, along with ten brand new essays exclusive to this collected edition, including a look at who's fault the cancellation was, the influence of big budget musicals on Trial of a Time Lord, and an interview with Rob Shearman about the Davison and Baker eras and his efforts writing for the latter with Big Finish.

It’s not meant to be. It’s one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll make in your life. But it is worth it. 

 At thirty, journalist Nicole Haddow had an unstable income, no financial plan and only credit-card debt to her name. But less than two years later she was a homeowner. 

 In Smashed Avocado, Nicole explains the steps she took to purchase her own home, and interviews other people who have found diverse ways to enter the property market, including rentvesting, flipping, Airbnb, tiny homes and buying regionally. She shares practical tips from property experts and the acquired wisdom of a new generation of homeowners – down to the micro-details. She even thrashes it out with Bernard Salt, the man who said young people should stop splashing out on expensive brunches if they want to own their own home. 

 Nicole’s story is inspiring and optimistic – but, most importantly, it’s realistic. The home ownership dream might look different today, but it’s still possible to make it a reality.

Ever wonder if your skills are good enough to compete in today’s crowded job market? You work hard, go above and beyond and still can’t seem to get noticed. Many of today’s jobs require that you be familiar with Microsoft Excel. How can you become proficient at Excel when companies aren’t willing to teach you this valuable skill?

This leaves many people trying to learn as they go and never quite feeling 100% comfortable with the program. What’s worse, most people haven’t even scratched the surface of Excel’s potential, even if they’ve been using it for years. If you feel this way, you’re not alone.

Think about this for a second; what will your career look like in a year if you don’t take action today and improve your Excel skills? How about five years from now? Unless you take matters into your own hands things may not look much different.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, people who show proficiency in Microsoft Excel and other common office applications earn, on average, 13% more than those who don’t. For most people  this could mean tens of thousands of dollars over just a few years, and this doesn’t even factor in lost promotions and job offers. Can you afford to leave so much on the table as a result of maintaining the status quo?

I’ve experienced this transformation in my career and can tell you first hand how it has helped me. When I was fresh out of college and working my first accounting job my manager asked me to complete a project that involved using VLOOKUPS. I enthusiastically obliged, walked back to my desk, and proceeded to panic. I tricked myself into thinking that I was an excel expert only because I knew a few formulas, my limited knowledge only scratched the surface. I turned to a college buddy for help; Google. I eventually managed to learn what I needed, after a lot of time and energy.

I’ve climbed the ladder and worn many hats since then. I can’t say that the opportunities I’ve earned in my career are solely due to my increasing Excel proficiency. What I can definitely say is that Excel has earned me more opportunities to prove myself to management than waiting for opportunities to materialize on their own.

That’s why I decided to write this book. My goal is to take you from Excel novice to master in the shortest time possible. I wrote my book specifically for the busy professional, in an easy to read manner that gets straight to the point and teaches the meat of Excel. I wrote this book for you.

Don’t take my word for it:

""I think the writing style is helpful for readers to engage. I like that as I read the book, I felt as if I was in front of someone who was actually teaching me. I also liked the fact that the book is written in a laid back manner. I mean Excel is difficult as it is, why would you want to make it worst by adding some weird terminology to the book? Its plain, simple and easy to follow.""

-Eliana Pereira, Accountant

I have helped many people improve their careers through Excel and now it’s your turn. Here is what you get when you download my book:

-18 chapters of the most useful Excel techniques that will immediately take your skills to the next level

Branding includes many factors which help a company be successful.  these factors may include a website, marketing efforts, and anything that gives a company an identity.  Consumers trust wholeheartedly a corporate image because there is a psychology in motivating the purchasing decisions.

The first edition was published in the United Kingdom in 1938. The book was not published in the United States until February 1952, when it appeared with an influential preface by Lionel Trilling.

Stern, domineering, fiercely loving, Lotty Kneen—born Dragica—was always tight-lipped about her early life and family history. She rebuffed Krissy’s curiosity and forbade her from taking the trip back to the old country that might have satisfied it.

When her grandmother died recently, Krissy finally felt at liberty to explore the questions that had nagged at her for so long. In The Three Burials of Lotty Kneen Krissy sets out with a box containing her grandmother’s ashes, intending to trace the old woman’s early life in Slovenia and Egypt, and perhaps locate some remnants of family. Along the way she uncovers the extraordinary story of the colony of Slovene women who became the nannies of choice for the wealthy Italians of pre-war Alexandria—and identifies as best she can the places where Lotty’s restless, demanding spirit will be at peace.

Krissy Kneen is the award-winning author of memoir—Affection—and fiction: An Uncertain Grace, Steeplechase, Triptych, The Adventures of Holly White and the Incredible Sex Machine, Wintering, as well as the Thomas Shapcott Award-winning poetry collection Eating My Grandmother. She has written and directed broadcast documentaries for SBS and ABC Television.

For the past 10 years, Inc. 500 CEO and #1 national best-selling author, Ryan Levesque--featured for his work in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Forbes, and Entrepreneur--has guided thousands of entrepreneurs through the journey of answering this question.

One of the biggest reasons why so many new businesses fail is because in the quest to decide what business to start, most of the conventional wisdom is wrong. 

Instead of obsessing over what--as in what should you sell or what should you build--you should first be asking who. As in who should you serve? 

The what is a logical question that will come soon enough. But choosing your who is the foundation from which all other things are built.

That is what this book is all about.

If you've ever had the dream to start your own business, become your own boss, or do your own thing--but have been afraid to take the leap and screw up your already good life--this book is for you.

You will find the meticulously tested, step-by-step process outlined in the book is easy to follow, despite being the result of a decade of research and experience. This process, designed to minimize your risk of failure and losing money up front, coupled with the inspiring stories of everyday people who have used this process to launch successful businesses, will not only give you clarity on what type of business to start, but also the confidence to finally take that leap and get started."

There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again.


The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among professionals.


I never lose my temper over the stock market. I never argue the tape. Getting sore at the market doesn’t get you anywhere.


They say you can never go poor taking profits. No, you don’t. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market. Where I should have made twenty thousand I made two thousand. That was what my conservatism did for me.


Remember that stocks are never too high for you to begin buying or too low to begin selling.


A man may see straight and clearly and yet become impatient or doubtful when the market takes its time about doing as he figured it must do. That is why so many men in Wall Street…nevertheless lose money. The market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brains they cannot sit tight.


After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was the sitting. Got that? My sitting tight!


Losing money is the least of my troubles. A loss never bothers me after I take it…But being wrong—not taking the loss—that is what does the damage to the pocketbook and to the soul.


Prices, like everything else, move along the line of least resistance. They will do whatever comes easiest.


The speculator’s chief enemies are always boring from within. It is inseparable from human nature to hope and to fear. In speculation when the market goes against you hope that every day will be the last day—and you lose more than you should had you not listened to hope—the same ally that is so potent a success-bringer to empire builders and pioneers, big and little. And when the market goes your way you become fearful that the next day will take away your profit, and you get out—too soon. Fear keeps you from making as much money as you ought to. The successful trader has to fight these two deep-seated instincts…Instead of hoping he must fear; instead of fearing he must hope."

Their income and livelihood is generated solely from their ability to take profits consistently out of the markets. The world of prop trading is mentally and emotionally challenging, but offers substantial rewards to the select few who can master this craft called trading.

Consumers must not be protected from Microsoft and Facebook, but they should be protected from public utilities, or any other state monopolies.

They would rather be learning from an irate customer than reading a textbook on how to handle an irate customer. If you are drawn to results that come from the best next actions, this book is for you. It addresses the most common execution problems that sales people have to tackle every day.

As an entrepreneur, sales person, sales manager, sales executive, customer, and client, I’ve spent over 35 years working with sales people who have been incredibly successful and some who have been incredibly unsuccessful. Combining my observations and experience, I’ve created a repeatable methodology that represents the ways the best sales people address customer problems and cause decision-makers to choose their offering way more often than that of their competition.

This book doesn’t have to be read cover to cover. It might be most useful to you as a reference tool rather than a traditional book. Think of it as a pre-Internet, pre-GPS, atlas full of maps. We used to keep an atlas in our cars and use them when we needed directions to get somewhere. The Five Abilities® of Incredible Successful Sales People is a guide full of common sales problems that you face daily. It will guide you through challenges that even the most experienced sales people occasionally need help with. Things like…

•How do you build a successful value proposition?
•What does a dream customer look like?
•How do you turn objections into the best opportunities you have?

If you’re just starting out in sales, The Five Abilities is a valuable head start on developing repeatable practices that win you more business. If you’re a sales veteran, The Five Abilities will be like having beers with peers, where you remind each other of actions that help you sell more. If you’re an entrepreneur, The Five Abilities will help you tune your value proposition to attract more of the right customers. If you’re a CEO, The Five Abilities will help you see why you are a major sales asset for your people and your company."

Do you want to save money?
Do you want to be Underspent, not overspent?

Right now, the rising cost of living is one of the biggest issues in Australia, America and the UK. According to the media, the average American owns 3.5 credit cards and owes US$15,799 in credit card debt. Three out of five American families can’t pay off their credit card debts. In the UK, someone is declared insolvent or bankrupt every five minutes, and a property is repossessed every eighteen minutes. Thirteen per cent of Australian adults and seventeen per cent of Aussie kids live below the poverty line, whilst the average Australian adult spends the first eight weeks of each year working just to pay for their car. There are more than eighteen million shopaholics in the United States, and five per cent of all waste in Australian landfill is discarded clothing.

In this groundbreaking and entertaining book, Rachel reveals the Seven-Step Process she took to break her shopping addiction and buying habit, without dramatically changing her life.

For Rachel, the ultimate result of implementing the seven steps set out in this book was:
•	being Underspent—spending less than usual (she was spending less money than was required and expected)
•	breaking her impulse shopping addiction and habit of buying ‘stuff’
•	saving 38 per cent of her net (take-home) annual salary
•	feeling happier and more content. 

This is a book that people can use, not just agree with. Underspent examines in detail the problems caused by impulse shopping addictions, what triggers our shopping and buying, the challenges and personal battles we face when quitting and the seven steps to being Underspent. This is a practical guide for men and women who want to quit shopping and save money. With case studies, stories, information and practical exercises, Rachel shows you how to apply the seven steps."

""You have to sell yourself in an interview"" is advice you hear all the time. However, it is rarely followed up with any useful instruction on how to do this. This book by Les Fenyves, a highly-experienced recruiter, salesman, and sales manager, corrects this deficiency. In it, Les describes the most important steps to take to sell yourself effectively in every interview, especially if you have no sales experience or training. The skills he teaches will enable you to:


	•	Get job offers from a higher percentage of your interviews.

	•	Get an offer even when your qualifications for the position are not ideal.

	•	Benefit from the interview even when you don’t get the offer.

	•	Approach every interview with confidence.


It is not the intent of this guide to turn you into a professional salesperson. Instead, it is meant to introduce you to only those basic selling skills that will be the most helpful to you and have the greatest positive impact as you interview for the next step in your career. This book will teach you some of the most important skills that successful sales people possess; i.e., how to:


	•	Know your product thoroughly, and you are the product.

	•	Prepare yourself for each interview in exactly the same way as a salesperson would.

	•	Control the interview through the skilled use of questioning techniques. An interview is not simply an oral exam where you passively answer questions that test your knowledge.

	•	Close before you leave; namely, ask for a commitment, or at a minimum, for feedback.

Many of today's rich and famous Internet marketing gurus won't exactly say so .... but they didn't start out with fat wallets stuffed full of cash. They didn't have huge advertising and operating budgets to skyrocket their businesses almost overnight.

—Wall Street Journal

Emmy award-winning journalist Andrew Kirtzman, explores “The Life and Lies of Bernie Madoff” in Betrayal—an in-depth, personal look at the architect of the biggest financial fraud in history. The New York Times calls Betrayal, “a novelistic, you-are-there sort of narrative,” and the shocking story of the King of the Swindlers—and his hundreds of celebrity and corporation victims, and the everyday people who tragically invested their life savings with him—does indeed read like a page-turning thriller. But it’s all amazingly, disturbingly true."

Spending time addressing the hands-on management of your practice equates to time you're not helping clients and you're not making money. We wrote this guide to help minimize distractions and maximize accelerated growth and practice value as you launch, grow, sustain, and exit your financial advisory practice.

What are the four secrets to accelerating growth and enhancing value in your practice? 

Secret One: Recognize your practice’s four lifecycle stages and the transition phases that support your move from one stage to the next.

Secret Two: Use a consistent, effective process to identify opportunities for accelerating growth and enhancing practice value in each lifecycle stage and transition phase with tools like the Opportunity Evaluator, the CRO Analyzer the Three-Step Model and the Adaptation Grid featured in this guide to help you make timely and effective choices.  These tools help you make opportunities a reality.

Secret Three: Build and empower a trustworthy team that includes employees and strategic partners who actively engage in creating a vision for growing the practice and enhancing its value, and who have the drive, skills and experience to make that vision a reality.

Secret Four: Create and execute a business plan that includes tactical steps to adapt to changes within and outside the company.


A financial advisory practice will progress more quickly when opportunities and choices about how to move ahead are clear. DKE Advisor Solutions examined and explored this process in a series of interviews with independent investment advisors and thought leaders in the investment advisor community.

We also drew on our experience working with dozens of advisors, from start-ups to mature firms. The result is The Financial Advisor Practice Lifecycle™, a framework for understanding your opportunity to accelerate growth and enhance practice value."

Reluctant to remain in Hungary until either the Nazis or the Soviets took over, he fled at the age of 23 with a forged exit visa and fifty pounds sterling to stave off hunger in Istanbul, Turkey. During his off hours as a dancer, he read some 200 books on the market and the great speculators, spending as much as eight hours a day studying.Darvas invested his money into a couple of stocks that had been hitting their 52-week high. He was utterly surprised that the stocks continued to rise and subsequently sold them to make a large profit. His main source of stock selection was Barron's Magazine. At the age of 39, after accumulating his fortune, Darvas documented his techniques in the book, How I Made 2,000,000 in the Stock Market. The book describes his unique ""Box System"", which he used to buy and sell stocks. Darvas' book remains a classic stock market text to this day."

He became a billionaire and investment sage by looking at companies as businesses rather than prices on a stock screen. The first two editions of The Warren Buffett Way gave investors their first in-depth look at the innovative investment and business strategies behind Buffett’s spectacular success. The new edition updates readers on the latest investments by Buffett. And, more importantly, it draws on the new field of behavioral finance to explain how investors can overcome the common obstacles that prevent them from investing like Buffett. 

 New material includes: 
 How to think like a long-term investor – just like Buffett Why “loss aversion”, the tendency of most investors to overweight the pain of losing money, is one of the biggest obstacles that investors must overcome. Why behaving rationally in the face of the ups and downs of the market has been the key to Buffett’s investing success Analysis of Buffett’s recent acquisition of H.J. Heinz and his investment in IBM stock   
The greatest challenge to emulating Buffett is not in the selection of the right stocks, Hagstrom writes, but in having the fortitude to stick with sound investments in the face of economic and market uncertainty. The new edition explains the psychological foundations of Buffett’s approach, thus giving readers the best roadmap yet for mastering both the principles and behaviors that have made Buffett the greatest investor of our generation."

Long time national financial radio host, educator, and investment advisor, Don McDonald shares, in an easy reading format, the truth about how investing is meant to work (for you) and some simple methods of avoiding bad investments and building a better portfolio for you future. This book is not meant to be a graduate course in economics or finance (nor do you need one). 


Financial Fysics is designed to fill a hole in most people's education. For most of our lives, we are taught that investing is little more than a game. Most student's first experience with the stock market came via a short-term stock picking assignment as part of a social studies class. The only knowledge imparted through that experience was that investing was no better than gambling. Those who picked the stock that grew the most over the next few weeks were declared the winners. No skill was involved in the process.


Dictionaries define investing with words like: venture, risk, and speculation. Is it any wonder that most people consider investing nothing more than a game of chance, a roll of the dice, a turn of the cards. As painlessly as possible, Financial Fysics sets out to provide that basic primer on money and investing that few, if any, of us received, at any point in our lives. It is an effort to counteract the effect of billions of dollars devoted to brainwashing us into believing that the only way to build investment wealth is to know or hire those whom we believe possess some secret knowledge about money.


If you are ready to manage your money responsibly and invest like a ""grown up,"" Financial Fysics is for you. Learn to build a better future for you, not your insurance agent of stockbroker, using time-tested, academically based methods in this brand new, interactive version of “Financial Fysics.”"

The fact that I'm sitting here writing a business book when, at school, I was the student who read the crib notes rather than the actual books is rather ironic. However, if I've proved anything over the years, it's that you needn't be the smartest girl in the room or get the highest marks (heck, I didn't even go to uni!) to succeed in PR or business. If I can do it, anyone can. The trick is to be willing to give up your excuses and consistently put in the work.


Roxy Jacenko built a PR empire on intuition, common sense and an unbreakable work ethic.

Book 1: This book can help you save time and money!

When doing taxes, accounting, or income statements, many people are puzzled. It starts with knowing what is what: the definitions. Then, filling out the balance sheets and the numbers, can be an equally complicated task as well. And finally, most people want to get the most out of their business or salary: The highest return, the lowest costs, and the lowest amount of taxes paid.

All of these concerns are real and they won’t go away on their own. But at least, with a book like this, you can take one step in the right direction.

This book’s aim is to teach you some of those necessary definitions, to break down what they mean, and to become more familiar with doing general accounting.

If this is what you’ve been looking for, then I encourage you to pick up the book and start reading or listening to it.

Book 2: When it comes to considering your finances, many decisions are involved. The numbers count!

So, in order to understand those numbers, some terms have to be understood first. The words that are used in the financial world, can be daunting at times. But fear no longer, my good friend. Help is on the way!

In this guide, you will learn more about the meaning and application of financial terms like these:

Dividends
Equity
Accumulated devaluation
Retained earnings
Sinking funds
Solvency
Subordinated financial obligation
Debt restructuring
And much more!

Many other words and their meanings will also be addressed. If you want to understand those metrics better, this book will be a great tool for you to become acquainted with the terminology and use of these issues."

Property buyers usually concentrate their research on realestate.com.au or domain.com.au, looking at glossy photos of beautifully staged homes – but really, they’d be better off working out how much they’ll need to borrow, how they should structure their loan and who would be the best lender.

Personal finance expert Stuart Wemyss compares finding the right loan to a game of snakes and ladders: you run up a ladder when you think you’ve found the lowest interest rate, only to slide down the snake when you realise the fees are high and conditions are stringent. ‘Interest is the single largest lifetime expense for investors,’ he says. ‘The amount of borrowings you carry, as an investor, affects your net worth and cash flow, and can make or break your retirement goals. Getting your borrowing right and structuring your investments correctly can save you a considerable amount of money – often thousands of dollars per year.’

To help you get your borrowing right, Stuart explains the Rules of the Lending Game, including:

	choosing the right loan products
	making the most of your equity
	calculating how much to borrow and how to reduce the overall cost, and
	structuring your loans to manage cash flow and create wealth."

Has the ""settle-for-less"" financial plan become your plan for wealth? It sounds a little something like this:


""Graduate from college, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks, save and penny-pinch for decades, trust your life-savings to an indexed-fund peddled from Wall Street, and then one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich.”



Welcome to the greatest scam of the modern world, one that will take you 50 years of your youth to realize that you were conned. You don’t want to DIE rich in life’s tired twilight, you want to LIVE rich in vibrant youth. 


Unfortunately, since you were old enough to work a job, you've been lied to by an army of financial profiteers and mainstream media hucksters. The ruse? The reckless idea that TIME can create wealth through patient investing with the most untrusted people on the planet… Wall Street. That’s right, invest in an indexed-fund for 50 years while blindly trusting the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market.


This soul-sapping, dream-stealing dogma is known as the “The Slowlane"" - an impotent financial gamble that dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair. Accept the Slowlane as your financial roadmap and your future will carelessly drift on a sailboat of HOPE: HOPE you can get a job and keep it, HOPE the stock market doesn't crash, HOPE the economy stays solvent, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE. Is HOPE really a solid centerpiece for family's financial plan?


Drive the Slowlane and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do, versus what you can.


If you refuse the lifetime subscription to mediocrity, penny-pinching, and “waiting to retire so I can finally enjoy life” there's an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth capable of burning a trail to financial independence faster than any road out there. And shockingly, this road has nothing to do with the Wall Street, jobs, 401(k)s, index-funds, or a mindless regimen of frugality. 


Demand more. Change lanes and create your explosive wealth accelerator. Hit the Fastlane, crack wealth’s code, and live rich young, and for a lifetime."

For all who know Brisbane, McWhirters, a once celebrated department store in Fortitude Valley, is an icon. For Melissa Fagan it is also the starting point for this remarkable exploration of her mother and grandmother’s lives, and a poignant  reminder of the ways in which retail stores and fashion have connected women’s lives across decades.

Behind the dusty shop counters of an Art Deco treasure, Fagan discovers both what has been lost and continues to shine. Ultimately this tender exploration of self and family, so exquisitely written,  speaks of the ways in which life so often surprises us and of how the legacies of others can truly enrich our own relationships and lives.

‘I raced through What Will Be Worn. It’s moving and alive, funny and tender. It is also a rigorous examination of the ways in which women shroud ourselves, figuratively and literally. I especially loved Melissa’s portrait of her mother, “the lost princess of Brisbane”. A very fine book.’ — Susan Johnson, author of The Landing

‘With delicacy, flair and an ever-questioning but never judgmental eye, Fagan performs beautifully the dance of writing history, slipping seamlessly back and forth between what is known and what must be imagined.’ — Peggy Frew, author of Hope Farm

‘It’s rare to find a book that so warmly and intelligently takes on themes such as the ways in which fashion links women across generations, the glamour and downfall of the department store, and the bonds between mothers and daughters. Melissa Fagan’s What Will Be Worn transcends the local with aplomb. It’s a loving and searching portrait of what we inherit from our families. It reminds me of Edmund de Waal’s The Hare with Amber Eyes and Helen Garner’s investigative and self-questioning writing style.’ — Barry Scott, Co-publisher at Transit Lounge"

Initially, she wrote it strictly for herself. Then, one day in 1944, Gerrit Bolkestein, a member of the Dutch government in exile, announced in a radio broadcast from London that after the war he hoped to collect eyewitness accounts of the suffering of the Dutch people under the German occupation, which could be made available to the public. As an example, he specifically mentioned letters and diaries.

Impressed by this speech, Anne Frank decided that when the war was over she would publish a book based on her diary. She began rewriting and editing her diary, improving on the text, omitting passages she didn’t think were interesting enough and adding others from memory. At the same time, she kept up her original diary. In the scholarly work The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition (1989), Anne’s first, unedited diary is referred to as version a, to distinguish it from her second, edited diary, which is known as version b.

The last entry in Anne’s diary is dated August 1, 1944. On August 4, 1944, the eight people hiding in the Secret Annex were arrested. Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, the two secretaries working in the building, found Anne’s diaries strewn all over the floor. Miep Gies tucked them away in a desk drawer for safekeeping. After the war, when it became clear that Anne was dead, she gave the diaries, unread, to Anne’s father, Otto Frank.

After long deliberation, Otto Frank decided to fulfill his daughter’s wish and publish her diary. He selected material from versions a and b, editing them into a shorter version later referred to as version c. Readers all over the world know this as The Diary of a Young Girl.

In making his choice, Otto Frank had to bear several points in mind. To begin with, the book had to be kept short so that it would fit in with a series put out by the Dutch publisher. In addition, several passages dealing with Anne’s sexuality were omitted; at the time of the diary’s initial publication, in 1947, it was not customary to write openly about sex, and certainly not in books for young adults. Out of respect for the dead, Otto Frank also omitted a number of unflattering passages about his wife and the other residents of the Secret Annex. Anne Frank, who was thirteen when she began her diary and fifteen when she was forced to stop, wrote without reserve about her likes and dislikes.

When Otto Frank died in 1980, he willed his daughter’s manuscripts to the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam. Because the authenticity of the diary had been challenged ever since its publication, the Institute for War Documentation ordered a thorough investigation. Once the diary was proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, to be genuine, it was published in its entirety, along with the results of an exhaustive study. The Critical Edition contains not only versions a, b and c, but also articles on the background of the Frank family, the circumstances surrounding their arrest and deportation, and the examination into Anne’s handwriting, the document and the materials used.

The Anne Frank—Fonds (Anne Frank Foundation) in Basel (Switzerland), which as Otto Frank’s legal heir had inherited his daughter’s copyrights, then decided to have a new, expanded edition of the diary published for general readers. This new edition in no way affects the integrity of the old one originally edited by Otto Frank, which brought the diary and its message to millions of people. The task of compiling the expanded edition was given to the writer and translator Mirjam Pressler. Otto Frank’s original selection has now been supplemented with passages from Anne’s a and b versions. Mirjam Pressler’s definitive edition, approved by the Anne Frank—Fonds, contains approximately 30 percent more material and is intended to give the reader more insight into the world of Anne Frank.

In 1998 the existence of five previously unknown pages of the diary came to light. Now, with the permission of the Anne Frank—Fonds in Basel, a long passage dated February 8, 1944, has been added to the end of the already-existing entry of that date. A short alternative to the entry of June 20, 1942, has not been included here because a more detailed version of it is already part of the diary. Furthermore, in line with recent findings, the entry of November 7, 1942, has been moved to October 30, 1943. For more information, the reader is referred to the revised Critical Edition.

In writing her second version (b), Anne invented pseudonyms for the people who would appear in her book. She initially wanted to call herself Anne Aulis, and later Anne Robin. Otto Frank opted to call his family by their own names and to follow Anne’s wishes with regard to the others. Over the years, the identity of the people who helped the families in the Secret Annex has become common knowledge. In this edition, the helpers are now referred to by their real names, as they so justly deserve to be. All other persons are named in accordance with the pseudonyms in The Critical Edition. The Institute for WarDocumentation has arbitrarily assigned initials to those persons wishing to remain anonymous.

The real names of the other people hiding in the Secret Annex are:

THE VAN PELS FAMILY

(from Osnabrück, Germany):

Auguste van Pels (born September 9, 1900)

Hermann van Pels (born March 31, 1898)

Peter van Pels (born November 8, 1926)

Called by Anne, in her manuscript: Petronella, Hans and Alfred van Daan; and in the book: Petronella, Hermann and Peter van Daan.

FRITZ PFEFFER

(born April 30, 1889, in Giessen, Germany):

Called by Anne, in her manuscript and in the book: Albert Dussel.

The reader may wish to bear in mind that much of this edition is based on the b version of Anne’s diary, which she wrote when she was around fifteen years old. Occasionally, Anne went back and commented on a passage she had written earlier. These comments are clearly marked in this edition. Naturally, Anne’s spelling and linguistic errors have been corrected. Otherwise, the text has basically been left as she wrote it, since any attempts at editing and clarification would be inappropriate in a historical document."

Growing up, the words finance, savings, and portfolio made Danielle Town’s eyes glaze over, and the thought of stocks and financial statements shut down her brain. The daughter of a successful investor and bestselling financial author of Rule #1, Phil Town, she spent most of her adult life avoiding investing—until she realized that her time-consuming career as lawyer was making her feel anything but in control of her life or her money. Determined to regain her freedom, vote for her values with her money, and deal with her fear of the unpredictable stock market, she turned to her father, Phil, to help her take charge of her life and her future through Warren Buffett-style value investing. Over the course of a year, Danielle went from avoiding everything to do with the financial industrial complex to knowing exactly how and when to invest in wonderful companies. 

In Invested, Danielle shows you how to do the same: how to take command of your own life and finances by choosing companies with missions that match your values, using the same gold standard strategies that have catapulted Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to the top of the Forbes 400. Avoiding complex math and obsolete financial models, she turns her father’s investing knowledge into twelve easy-to understand lessons. 

In each chapter, Danielle examines the investment strategies she mastered as her increasing know-how deepens the trust between her and her father. Throughout, she streamlines the process of making wise financial decisions and shows you just how easy—and profitable—investing can be.

Capturing a warm, charming, and down-to-earth give and take between a headstrong daughter and her mostly patient dad, Invested makes the complex world of investing simple, straightforward, and approachable, and will help you formulate your own investment plan—and foster the confidence to put it into action."

This is a long and complex subject for a single e-book. To facilitate the explanation and the delivery of the material, an e-book will be published in each logic set of topics.

The following are the planned titles of the book series:

Your Wealth
The first book looks at the time savings gained by a single person increasing his physical and mind assets in an island.

The Wealth of Your Neighbor
The second book is about the agreements that two people have to make to be in a path of increasing their respective wealth.

The Wealth of the Market
The third book explains the opportunities offered by a free market to produce wealth for the people that participate in it. This book explains the wealth production results when there is a market that brings the competitive advantage of every individual to the table.

The Wealth of the Business Enterprise
The fourth book is about the function of the business enterprise to produce wealth for its customers, its owners, and its employees.

The Wealth of the State
The fifth book discusses what happens when we remove the assumption that everybody is going to behave correctly. The book explores the historical formation of the state and the implications for the production of wealth.

The Wealth of Social Capital
The sixth book is the core of the series. Social Capital is defined as the ability of a society to learn and agree on the rules that are necessary for the production of wealth. This is the key for the wealth of the people in society. This is the ingredient that is a prerequisite for physical and human capital formation and is the ingredient missing in many countries that are not able to achieve wealth.

The Wealth of Physical Capital
The seventh book is about the wealth of the physical capital that humanity has today. It should make you grateful that you live in this age and not five hundred or five thousand years ago.

The Wealth of Human Capital
The eighth book is about the wealth of the human capital that humanity has today. A great deal of the human capital available is taken for granted and it is wasted so it will be good to review it.

The Wealth of a Nation
The ninth book takes us to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. A nation is an entity that comprises a geographical area with a legal setting. It is governed by a state that is the keeper of the social contract. The state maintains the rules of a nation’s Social Capital and thus determines the capital structure of the nation and its citizens and in this way the state determines the income of its citizens.

The Wealth of the Planet Earth
The tenth book is about our planet. It introduces the concept of Natural Capital. What we think of natural resources is actually the capitalization of life that has been happening for millions of years. Unfortunately, many of the actions that we do in the pursuit of wealth production reduce the planet’s natural capital. If the planet was treated as a capital asset, it would be maintained correctly and it would not be consumed risking a drop of the whole world to a lower income level.

That's the desperate cry from salespeople as they try to win deals in competitive marketplaces. While the easy answer is to lower the price, the company sacrifices margin--oftentimes unnecessarily.

To win deals at the prices you want,the strategy needed is differentiation. Most executives think marketing is the sole source of differentiation. But what about the sales function of the company? This commonly neglected differentiation opportunity provides a multitude of ways to stand out from the competition. This groundbreaking book teaches you how to develop those strategies.

In Sales Differentiation, sales management strategist, Lee B. Salz presents nineteen easy-to-implement concepts to help salespeople win deals while protecting margins. These concepts apply to any salesperson in any industry and are based on the foundation that ""how you sell, not just what you sell, differentiates you."" 

The strategies are presented in easy-to-understand stories and can quickly be put into practice. Divided into two sections, the ""what you sell"" chapters help salespeople:
Recognize that the expression ""we are the best"" causes differentiation to backfire.Avoid the introspective question that frustrates salespeople and ask the right question to fire them up.Understand what their true differentiators are and how to effectively position them with buyers.Find differentiators in every nook and cranny of the company using the six components of the ""Sales Differentiation Universe.""Create strategies to position differentiators so buyers see value in them.
The ""how you sell"" section teaches salespeople how to provide meaningful value to buyers and differentiate themselves in every stage of the sales process. This section helps salespeople:
Develop strategies to engage buyers and turn buyer objections into sales differentiation opportunities.Shape buyer decision criteria around differentiators.Turn a commoditized Request for Proposal (RFP) process into a differentiation opportunity. Use a buyer request for references as a way to stand out from the competition.Leverage the irrefutable, most powerful differentiator...themselves.
Whether you've been selling for twenty years or are new to sales, the tools you learn in Sales Differentiation will help you knock-out the competition, build profitable new relationships, and win deals at the prices you want."

In a time of treat misuse of power, it offers sound guidance for an emerging power-positive ethic that brings compassion to power. Original and engaging the approach highlights four dimensions of personal, professional and status power: Be Informed and Present, Be Compassionate and Self-aware, Be Connected and Accountable, Be Skillful and Wise. This book provides skills, self-awareness, and understanding of the gifts and perils of power.

This is a guide and resource for professional relationships. Power is defined simply as the ability to act or to have an effect. It is thus potential that can be used to exploit or harm or it can be used to heal and repair harm, promote well-being and the common good, and to evolve situations. When you say “yes” to the additional power and influence that is embedded in a position of power, you can learn to stand in your power while staying in your heart. The book envisions ethics in its largest container as the right use of power and addresses topics not usually covered in ethics education: personal power, shame, non-ordinary states, impact and intention, influence/values/diversity, leadership and power dynamics, challenges, gifts and shadow of power, and ethics as soul work and world service. The book also teaches skills needed to use power wisely and well: resolving difficulties, feedback, self-care. This is an e-book that you’ll be glad to carry with you."

ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE ""RIGHT"" RISKS?

Do you worry more about radiation from nuclear power or from the sun?

Are you more afraid of getting cancer than heart disease?

Are you safer talking on your cell phone or using a hands-free device when you drive?

Do you think global warming is a serious threat to your health?

GET THE FACTS BEHIND YOUR FEARS—AND DISCOVER . . . HOW RISKY IS IT, REALLY?

International risk expert David Ropeik takes an in-depth look at our perceptions of risk and explains the hidden factors that make us unnecessarily afraid of relatively small threats and not afraid enough of some really big ones. This read is a comprehensive, accessible, and entertaining mixture of what's been discovered about how and why we fear—too much or too little. It brings into focus the danger of The Perception Gap: when our fears don’t match the facts, and we make choices that create additional risks.

This book will not decide for you what is really risky and what isn't. That's up to you. HOW RISKY IS IT, REALLY? will tell you how you make those decisions. Understanding how we perceive risk is the first step toward making wiser and healthier choices for ourselves as individuals and for society as a whole.

Whether you want to write a succintly or more elaborate problem definition you have 2 options. Either you start from scratch or you use a checklist.

Over the years I collected questions for a checklist, which is on the next page. 

In my experience a checklist saves you time (waste!) and gives you a more comprehensive problem defintion. 

You don’t have to answer ALL the questions, just see them as a trigger to write down what occurs in your mind when you read the question.

Sticky notes are very helpfull.

The sticky notes are the “fuel” for the problem definition. 

The checklist and sticky notes also work well in a team.

Those who are familiar with User Story Mapping (Jeff Patton), try to map the sticky notes! Have fun!

In The Little Book that Beats the Market—a New York Times bestseller with 300,000 copies in print—Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, The Little Book that Still Beats the Market updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author’s time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You’ll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone “knows” it. 
While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market.

As the Wall Street Journal stated about the original edition, “Mr. Greenblatt…says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His ‘Little Book’ is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there.”"

In the years since the publication of First, Break All the Rules and Now, Discover Your Strengths, millions have come to the simple but powerful realization that to get the most out of people, you must build on their strengths. And yet, as Marcus Buckingham astutely points out, though the strengths-based approach is now conventional wisdom, the tools and systems inside organizations—performance appraisals, training programs, and succession planning systems—remain stubbornly remedial and exclusively focused on measuring skills, finding gaps, and attempting to plug them. It’s a crisis for individuals and organizations, with management ideas and everyday practice utterly out of sync.

That’s about to change. StandOut 2.0 is a revolutionary book and tool that enables you to identify your strengths, and those of your team, and act on them. The original edition of StandOut provided top-notch insights from one of the world’s foremost authorities on strengths, as well as access to a powerful, cutting-edge online assessment tool. StandOut 2.0 also includes the assessment and a robust report on your most dominant strengths. The report is easily exported so you can use it to present the very best of yourself to your team and your company.

Close to him on the mood are the works of Kisling in the early twenties.

But if his comrades, as, for example, Soutine, features expressionism manifested in almost grotesque sharpness of the images, then they get a lyrical, poetic interpretation of Kisling. His penchant for a certain idealization of the model later helped him to consolidate in the role of a fashionable portraitist writing secular ladies and actresses.

He always worked hard. Unlike other artists, his working day was strictly regulated - he started at 9 am, when they came to pose models, he was interrupted for lunch, which he shared with friends in the Rotunda, the House or the Dome, then again, in the evening again meeting with friends, now during dinner."

Without even being aware of it, many of us operate from an inward mindset, a single-minded focus on our own goals and objectives. This book points out the many ways, some quite subtle and deceptive, that this mindset invites tension and conflict. But incredible things happen when people switch to an outward mindset. They intuitively understand what coworkers, colleagues, family, and friends need to be successful and happy. Their organizations thrive, and astonishingly, by focusing on others they become happier and more successful themselves! This new mindset brings about deep and far-reaching changes. 

The Outward Mindset presents compelling true stories to illustrate the gaps that individuals and organizations typically experience between their actual inward mindsets and their needed outward mindsets. And it provides simple yet profound guidance and tools to help bridge this mindset gap. This new edition includes a new preface, updated case studies, and new material covering Arbinger's latest research on mindsets. In the long run, changing negative behavior without changing one's mindset doesn't last—the old behaviors always reassert themselves. But changing the mindset that causes the behavior changes everything."

“Emily Nussbaum is the perfect critic—smart, engaging, funny, generous, and insightful.”—David Grann, author of Killers of the Flower Moon

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR • Chicago Tribune • Esquire • Library Journal • Kirkus Reviews

 From her creation of the “Approval Matrix” in New York magazine in 2004 to her Pulitzer Prize–winning columns for The New Yorker, Emily Nussbaum has argued for a new way of looking at TV. In this collection, including two never-before-published essays, Nussbaum writes about her passion for television, beginning with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the show that set her on a fresh intellectual path. She explores the rise of the female screw-up, how fans warp the shows they love, the messy power of sexual violence on TV, and the year that jokes helped elect a reality-television president. There are three big profiles of television showrunners—Kenya Barris, Jenji Kohan, and Ryan Murphy—as well as examinations of the legacies of Norman Lear and Joan Rivers. The book also includes a major new essay written during the year of #MeToo, wrestling with the question of what to do when the artist you love is a monster.

More than a collection of reviews, the book makes a case for toppling the status anxiety that has long haunted the “idiot box,” even as it transformed. Through it all, Nussbaum recounts her fervent search, over fifteen years, for a new kind of criticism, one that resists the false hierarchy that elevates one kind of culture (violent, dramatic, gritty) over another (joyful, funny, stylized). I Like to Watch traces her own struggle to punch through stifling notions of “prestige television,” searching for a more expansive, more embracing vision of artistic ambition—one that acknowledges many types of beauty and complexity and opens to more varied voices. It’s a book that celebrates television as television, even as each year warps the definition of just what that might mean.

FINALIST FOR THE PEN/DIAMONSTEIN-SPIELVOGEL AWARD FOR THE ART OF THE ESSAY

“This collection, including some powerful new work, proves once and for all that there’s no better American critic of anything than Emily Nussbaum. But I Like to Watch turns out to be even greater than the sum of its brilliant parts—it’s the most incisive, intimate, entertaining, authoritative guide to the shows of this golden television age.”—Kurt Andersen, author of Fantasyland

“Reading Emily Nussbaum makes us smarter not just about what we watch, but about how we live, what we love, and who we are. I Like to Watch is a joy.”—Rebecca Traister"

Cross-border capital flows have collapsed, particularly among advanced economies. Europe, once in the vanguard of financial globalization, has seen cross-border integration go into reverse: Eurozone banks have reduced foreign claims by $3.7 trillion since 2007. The report explains what is driving these reversals and why they matter. If current trends persist, we risk dampening global economic growth.

A young man lives unhappily in a valley. One day he meets an old man who lives on a mountain peak. At first the young man doesn’t realize that he is talking to one of the most peaceful and successful people in the world. But in the course of further encounters and conversations, the young man comes to understand that he can apply the old man’s remarkable principles and practical tools to his own life to change it for the better. Spencer Johnson knows how to tell a deceptively simple story that teaches deep lessons. The One Minute Manager (co-written with Ken Blanchard) sold 15 million copies and stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for more than twenty years.

A translation into English by A. S. Kline with illustrations by Eugène Delacroix.


Goethe’s two-part dramatic work, Faust, based on a traditional theme, and finally completed in 1831, is an exploration of that restless intellectual and emotional urge which found its fullest expression in the European Romantic movement, to which Goethe was an early and major contributor. Part I of the work outlines a pact Faust makes with the devil, Mephistopheles, and encompasses the tragedy of Gretchen, whom Faust seduces. Part II, developed over a long period of Goethe’s later life, reflects Goethe’s own transition from a predominantly Romantic to a wider world-view and explores more extensive themes, including the values of the Classical past, as it moves towards the work’s resolution.


The protagonist, Faust, is presented in a complex manner, and Goethe’s treatment of the subject matter raises ethical and spiritual issues, many of which are not resolved within the drama itself. Goethe’s stress is on Faust’s striving towards the good, and on the nature of human error, rather than on the traditional Christian view of sin and redemption, and the play’s opening sections and its conclusion can be seen as humanist allegory or metaphor rather than an expression of orthodox religious belief. It is left to the reader to draw their own conclusion about Faust’s everyman character, and the extent to which he earns his ultimate spiritual salvation.

The play had an enormous influence on later German thought and literature, and together with his lyric poetry has ensured Goethe’s place among the great European writers.

His influence is due largely to two publications, the only two cited in the announcement of his Nobel Prize: “The Nature of the Firm” (1937) and “The Problem of Social Cost” (1960). These two articles are among the most-cited works in economics. The ideas Coase developed in these two works led to entirely new fields of inquiry in economics, law, management, and political science, and in conjunction with his article on using markets to allocate radio spectrum (Coase 1959), spawned new market design theory and practice that helped to transform our society and enable innovation and digitization.

Coase’s style of theory, analysis, and persuasion was narrative, fact-driven, and much less formal than is the norm in economics. Coase spent his career asking deceptively simple questions that revealed profound complexities in the arrangement of economic activity. Why do firms exist? Why don’t we allocate scarce resources such as radio spectrum by using markets instead of regulation? Can people resolve conflicts over resource use through bargaining and contracts, or is government regulation necessary? Is a lighthouse a public good that requires government provision? How does a durable goods monopolist price its output?

Ronald Harry Coase was born in Willesden, a London suburb, on December 29, 1910. While attending the University of London, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1932, Coase was awarded the Sir Ernest Cassell Travelling Scholarship. This scholarship enabled him to travel to the United States, study at the University of Chicago from 1931 to 1932 with Frank Knight and Jacob Viner, and visit several factories to learn how they organized production. In particular, his visits to Ford and General Motors factories provided an empirical foundation for his first paper, “The Nature of the Firm” (1937). He initially taught in the UK, and then his academic career saw him migrate to the US. After some years at the University of Virginia, he spent most of his career on the law faculty at the University of Chicago (starting in 1964), where he also served as an editor of the Journal of Law and Economics.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1991 “for his discovery and clarification of the significance of transaction costs and property rights for the institutional structure and functioning of the economy.” 

Coase was consistently critical of what he called a “blackboard economics” approach to economic theory that focuses on optimization models with defined constraints, not on the actual structures of interactions and relationships that underlie economic activity. In many ways Coase found this to be empty theorizing because it overlooked precisely what is economic—the diverse ways people organize production and economic activity for mutual benefit. 

Coase wrote and worked until his death on September 2, 2013."

I've used SMR for years to get better returns than the S&P 500 index and ""beat the market.""

Following the SMR system has several benefits:

* It has a long-term outlook that eliminates the need for any kind of market timing or short-term predictions.

* It encourages buying many stocks to diversify your portfolio and reduce risk.

* Its ""hands-off"" approach requires you to pay attention to the stock market only once a week, at most.

* You can invest aggressively in high-risk growth stocks without taking on a lot of risk and stress.

* SMR is a system, not a strategy, so it can evolve with you as you gain knowledge and your financial circumstances change.

Essentially, SMR involves buying and selling stocks at regular intervals and keeping track of your investments and strategies using spreadsheets and portfolio applications. It is a system for long-term investing that requires you to hold each stock for over a year to achieve better returns than the S&P 500."

A major reason for the singular celebrity of this most popular and versatile of the great French writers is Les Misérables (1862). In this story of the trials of the peasant Jean Valjean — a man unjustly imprisoned, baffled by destiny, and hounded by his nemesis, the magnificently realized, ambiguously malevolent police detective Javert — Hugo achieves the sort of rare imaginative resonance that allows a work of art to transcend its genre.
Les Misérables is at once a tense thriller that contains one of the most compelling chase scenes in all literature, an epic portrayal of the nineteenth-century French citizenry, and a vital drama — highly particularized and poetic in its rendition but universal in its implications — of the redemption of one human being.

One of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world. —Upton Sinclair
The greatest of all novels. —Leo Tolstoy
Hugo is unquestionably the most powerful talent that has appeared in France in the nineteenth century. —Fyodor Dostoyevsky

In reality, independent investors are making great returns on their investments every day. They are selecting solid opportunities, receiving substantial dividends and saving a fortune in fees. Their secret? Realising that the most confusing barrier to the best returns is confusion itself.

Check out any investment arm of any bank and the language alone can make your head spin. Without a degree in financial jargon how can we hope to wade through the multitudinous opportunities to find good investments that pay the returns we want? Should we invest in stocks or bonds? Which companies offer the best returns for minimal risk? What’s algorithmic trading? A shadow bank?

Surely it’s best to use an investment adviser, someone who understands and can translate for us? Isn’t that the smart thing to do?

The value of financial assets under management rose to an all time high of US $70 trillion at the end of 2013. While every piece of marketing literature you read about asset management services will expound the benefits they bring investors, these products are designed to make money for institutions, not individuals.

It’s time to trust your gut and lose the doubts: investing can be simple and the best person to manage your investments is you. Financial professionals want investors to feel stupid because they need us to need them.

But, to quote Warren Buffett, “You don’t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ.”

In this eBook we explore the deliberately confusing world of finance, examine how asset managers are profiting from peddling the perception of their safety in a dangerous world and learn how independent investors are doing it better for themselves."

Think HBO's Sex and the City meets HBO's Insecure. FBTGC is sexy, funny, and honest. 

A collection of stories about self-love, sexual health awareness, and navigating emotions: Carolyn Toney straps you in and takes you on a journey of life and sexuality written with a comedic flair. From the graphic sexual descriptions that will make you blush to the abrupt and unforeseen pitfalls that dating in the digital era come with, she retells stories of heartbreak, therapy, and racism to remind you that you're reading stories that someone actually lived. 

The book champions sex-positivity, putting yourself first, and not shying away from uncomfortable topics, like being herpes positive. Some refer to being positive within the herpes-positive community as having glitter —You know because glitter lasts forever. By bringing the virus to the front of the conversation, she hopes that the stigma can one day be broken. She discusses her diagnosis so candidly it will make you realize how common it is, and it will make you question, Why is there a stigma in the first place? 

From Behind The Glitter Curtain is her literary coming-out story. 

This book is honest, vulnerable, and unapologetically human."

 David Ogilvy wrote that ""Nobody should be allowed to have anything to do with advertising until he has read this book seven times. It changed the course of my life.""


The book is cited as being the original description of the process of split testing and of coupon based customer tracking and loyalty schemes. In the book, Hopkins outlines an advertising approach based on testing and measuring. In this way losses from unsuccessful ads are kept to a safe level while gains from profitable ads are multiplied. Or, as Hopkins wrote, the advertiser is ""playing on the safe side of a hundred to one shot"".

‘TAKEN’ combines stunning photography, film footage, audio commentaries, interactive maps and images and video interviews to take the reader behind locked doors into Kamathipura, Mumbai’s oldest and largest red light district.   

 

‘TAKEN’ is the result of a consuming 11 year undercover investigation by award winning British photojournalist Hazel Thompson, who dramatically exposes the real life stories of women and girls tricked, trafficked and sold into modern sex slavery in unprecedented depth and detail.


Thompson gained the trust of women and children who have been kidnapped, caged, raped and sold into sex slavery, many of whom were born into prostitution or sold as babies. “I went into Kamathipura with my camera because I wanted to open people’s eyes to the reality of the red light district. It is not a place of pleasure; it is a place of pain. It’s a warzone where pimps and gangs enslave the girls, cage and break them as part of a system in which the police collude and cooperate.”


Hazel Thompson will donate worldwide profits from sales of each ‘TAKEN’ ebook to British charity Jubilee Campaign who have set up the ‘TAKEN’ Campaign to rescue and rehabilitate girls and women from Mumbai’s sex industry.


A campaign will be launched to urge the Indian government to criminalize the purchase of sex and to follow new legislation in Sweden. A bespoke App will be created to mobilize support for the campaign.

It's clear, concise and gets to the heart of the camera's multiple and often confusing options. Very highly recommended - for experienced user and beginner alike.

-G.S.A.

How to save your pocket money
How to be a cheapskate and keep your friends
How to read the market like a pro

""ETF für Einsteiger"" ist eine praktische, benutzerfreundliche Ressource, die dich in die Welt der börsengehandelten Fonds einführt und dir das Wissen vermittelt, das du brauchst, um ETFs in deine Anlagestrategie einzubeziehen.

Ergänze dein Wissen und Verständnis der mit ETF-Anlagen verbundenen Risiken und Chancen und überlege, wie ETF-Anlagen dein aktuelles Portfolio ergänzen können.

Du lernst:

• Was sind Indexfonds und wie werden sie formuliert?

• Treffe  fundierte Anlageentscheidungen auf der Basis von grundlegenden Kenntnissen über den ETF-Markt

• Informieren dich über die neuesten ETF-Produkte, -Anbieter und -Strategien, die dich bei der Auswahl der richtigen Produkte für deine Anforderungen unterstützen

• Erhöhe die Vielfalt deines Anlageportfolios und bringe neue Möglichkeiten in deine Anlagestrategie ein.

• Ihre theoretischen und praktischen Mängel und Einschränkungen

• BONUS: Anwendung des 80/20-Anlageansatzes auf Indexfonds, die anhand mehrerer Beispiele und Fallstudien näher gebracht wird

• Untersuche die Auswirkungen des Wachstums des verwalteten ETF-Portfolios

• Und vieles mehr!

Während ETFs wie Aktien handeln, sind sie keine Aktien - und die Unterschiede wirken sich auf jeden Aspekt ihrer Verwendung aus.

Wie kann man mit Aktien Geld verdienen?

Erster Schritt: Handel nicht mit Aktien. In einer radikalen Abkehr von den meisten Anlagebüchern zeigt ein ehemaliger Daytrader, wie eine einfache Asset Allocation-Strategie, die sich an veränderte Marktbedingungen anpasst, in den letzten 10 Jahren eine durchschnittliche jährliche Rendite von 12% erzielt hat.

Was bedeutet eine Rendite von 12%?

Wenn du mit den Grundlagen des Investierens vertraut bist, weißt du, dass diese Zahl der Verdoppelung der durchschnittlichen Rendite des Referenzindex S & P 500 nahe kommt. Außerdem übertrifft sie 99% aller Investmentfonds.

Aber was ist Outperformance ohne Schutz? Als der S&P 500 2008 abstürzte und 37% seines Wertes verlor, erzielte dieser Plan tatsächlich eine Rendite von + 10,9%.

Schlage den Markt mit diesem einzigartigen ETF-Handelssystem.

Schlage die Straße und baue mit dieser einfachen ETF-Rotationsstrategie, die die Entscheidungsfindung automatisiert, das Risiko und die Volatilität deines Portfolios reduziert und dich nachts tief und fest schlafen lässt, ohne dir Sorgen um Marktbären oder platzende Blasen zu machen, langfristigen Wohlstand an den Aktienmärkten auf.

Das kann jeder.

Wenn du 20 Minuten im Monat und einen Computer hast, kannst du jeden Investitionsbetrag in eine stetig wachsende Compoundiermaschine verwandeln.

Das Fazit ist, dass die Leute entweder kein Wissen über Investitionen haben oder zu ängstlich sind, um loszulegen. Mit jeder Art von Investition geht ein gewisses Maß an Unsicherheit einher. Wir hoffen, dass du beim Erlernen des Investierens feststellst, dass es nicht so kompliziert und riskant ist, wie du vielleicht denkst. Es ist vielmehr eine Notwendigkeit, dein Vermögen über die traditionellen Methoden hinaus zu steigern.

Wenn du bereit bist, dein Geld vom Sparkonto abzuheben und größere finanzielle Schritte zu unternehmen, warte nicht länger. Hole dir noch heute ein Exemplar dieses Buches und lerne passive Fonds kennen, damit du größere finanzielle Gewinne erzielen kannst.

Sobald du dies tust, hast du eine völlig andere Sichtweise auf Geld und Finanzen."

The greatest investment advisor of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham taught and inspired people worldwide. Graham's philosophy of “value investing”—which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies—has made The Intelligent Investor the stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949.

Over the years, market developments have proven the wisdom of Graham’s strategies. While preserving the integrity of Graham’s original text, this revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today’s market, draws parallels between Graham’s examples and today’s financial headlines, and gives readers a more thorough understanding of how to apply Graham’s principles.

Who will help lead us to a better future? Business.

These massive dual challenges—and other profound shifts, such as pandemics, resource pressures, and shrinking biodiversity—threaten our very existence. Other megatrends, such as the push for a clean economy and the unprecedented focus on diversity and inclusion, offer exciting new opportunities to heal the world, and prosper by doing so. Government cannot do this alone. Business must step up.

In this seminal book, former Unilever CEO Paul Polman and sustainable business guru Andrew Winston explode fifty years of corporate dogma. They reveal, for the first time, key lessons from Unilever and other pioneering companies around the world about how you can profit by fixing the world's problems instead of creating them. To thrive today and tomorrow, they argue, companies must become ""net positive""—giving more to the world than they take. A net positive company:
Improves the lives of everyone it touches, from customers and suppliers to employees and communities, greatly increasing long-term shareholder returns in the process.Takes ownership of all the social and environmental impacts its business model creates.

The Boglehead's Guide to Investing is a DIY handbook that espouses the sage investment wisdom of John C. Bogle. This witty and wonderful book offers contrarian advice that provides the first step on the road to investment success, illustrating how relying on typical ""common sense"" promoted by Wall Street is destined to leave you poorer. This updated edition includes new information on backdoor Roth IRAs and ETFs as mainstream buy and hold investments, estate taxes and gifting, plus changes to the laws regarding Traditional and Roth IRAs, and 401k and 403b retirement plans. With warnings and principles both precisely accurate and grandly counterintuitive, the Boglehead authors show how beating the market is a zero-sum game.

Investing can be simple, but it's certainly not simplistic. Over the course of twenty years, the followers of John C. Bogle have evolved from a loose association of investors to a major force with the largest and most active non-commercial financial forum on the Internet. The Boglehead's Guide to Investing brings that communication to you with comprehensive guidance to the investment prowess on display at Bogleheads.org. You'll learn how to craft your own investment strategy using the Bogle-proven methods that have worked for thousands of investors, and how to:
 Choose a sound financial lifestyle and diversify your portfolio Start early, invest regularly, and know what you're buying Preserve your buying power, keeping costs and taxes low Throw out the ""good"" advice promoted by Wall Street that leads to investment failure

I’m not obsessed with sex. I just can’t stop thinking about it.’

The Fleabag bites back. A rip-roaring account of some sort of female living her sort of life.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s debut play is an outrageously funny monologue for a female performer. It premiered at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, performed by Phoebe herself, before transferring to Soho Theatre, London, for several successful runs, followed by a UK tour. 

It won a Fringe First Award in Edinburgh, the Most Promising New Playwright and Best Female Performance at the Off West End Theatre Awards, The Stage Award for Best Solo Performer and the Critics’ Circle Award for Most Promising Playwright. It received a Special Commendation in the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize and was nominated for the Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre. In 2016 it was turned into a wildly successful and ‘utterly riveting’ (Guardian) BBC television series.

This edition also features an introduction by the author.

‘Believe the hype, Waller-Bridge’s raw writing… really is as good as everyone says’ - The Stage

One more needless traffic jam on your evening commute or another bad day at the office, and it's easy to wonder if you couldn't just build your own business instead.


Scratching that itch is easy if you start an online business. Unlike real-world stores, here's no storefront to rent and no sign to hang—all you'll need is a free afternoon, something to sell, and perhaps $30 or less.


You could start without a dedicated online store of your own yet. Perhaps you'd like to sell your products on the internet's equivalent of a superstore or flea market, like Amazon or eBay. Maybe your product isn't done yet, and you need pre-orders from an app like Kickstarter. You might just want to sell one product, and only need a simple checkout experience for it, or you may want to build your own full-featured online store. It's not that hard.


Starting a full-fledged online business selling things, however, is a far more difficult thing. You'll need a name for your company, funds to get your business off the ground and running, and, perhaps, a business plan and formal legal structure.


Whether you want to sell a few things occasionally or a lot of things regularly, this is the book for you. It will walk you through the questions you need to answer and the boxes you need to check before starting a business. Then, it'll help you pick out eCommerce software, walk you through setting it up, and leave you with tips-and-tricks to make the most of your store.


It's the perfect guide to getting your own special corner of the internet to stake your claim with your own business. You're in for a fun ride.

It summarizes the collective wisdom and hard work of over 70 exemplary chief HR officers and other leaders.  Their mission:  Disruptively accelerate the progress of the HR profession to meet the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of the new world of work.  “Black Holes” are things that have been talked about for years in HR, but remain stubbornly unresolved. “White Spaces” are things that get far too little attention from HR, but that must be addressed to have a pivotal impact on the future workplace and the success of HR and organizations.



These leaders committed to a three-year collective effort dubbed CHREATE -- The Global Consortium to Reimagine HR, Employment Alternatives, Talent, and the Enterprise.  They recruited their colleagues and led volunteer teams that tackled the tough challenges, demonstrated how to address them, and built open-source tools and frameworks for leaders like you to use in your own organization.  The project was guided by these common beliefs: open source, voluntary, inclusive, messy, and agile.   CHREATE focused on four key pillars of change, that organize this book:  1. Align HR with Value Creation for Organizations that Win; 2. Shape Expectations of HR’s Key Constituents; 3. Rewire the Work and Tools of HR; and 4. Enhance the HR Talent Pipeline.



In this eBook, you’ll find 26 essays from a wide range of CHREATE Project volunteers, people who have contributed their expertise, time, and passion to raising the bar for the HR profession. The essays not only describe the frameworks and tools to disruptively accelerate HR’s progress, they often provide links to prototypes, guides and tools.  



Please join the movement!  Use this book as your platform to disruptively accelerate HR and work in your organization."

But few have mastered the ability to quickly and easily make money flipping houses while on vacation, like Joe McCall.

Inside this book, Jason Medley hosts Joe McCall as he reveals his simple and proven systems to automate, delegate and outsource nearly every function of his business except cashing his checks. He shows the exact steps that has allowed him to go on multiple vacations with his family throughout the year while having his system continue to flip houses for him.

Inside: You Will Discover The 4 Keys to Automated House Flipping Success:

Marketing Autopilot: How to get buyers and sellers to call YOU first!

Automation: How to Systematize your entire business so you are practically making money in your sleep

Delegation: How to use “troops on the ground” and Virtual Assistants to get everything done for you.

Sales/Closing: Exactly what to say and how to say it to get buyers and sellers to want to work with you.

Included are case studies, examples and outsourcing techniques to build your business so you can enjoy your life. You will see how to track your leads or have someone else track them for you. Joe even reveals how to close a deal without ever seeing the property or the seller.

New investors (even those looking for their first deal) will benefit from this training by discovering an easier way to get started and automate or delegate the activities and skills they are still developing, thus shortcutting their path to success.

Experienced investors will realize that they can scale their business faster and higher while doing less work by employing these methods across their business.

 From 1968 through 1972, Harlan Ellison penned a series of weekly columns, sharing his uncompromising thoughts about contemporary television programming for the Los Angeles Free Press, a.k.a. “The Freep,” a countercultural, underground newspaper. Sitcoms and variety shows, westerns and cop dramas, newscasts and commercials, Ellison left no pixilated stone unturned, expounding on the insipidness, hypocrisy, and malaise found in the glowing images projected into the faces of American audiences.
  
The Glass Teat: Essays of Opinion on the Subject of Television collects fifty-two of Ellison’s columns—including his 2011 introduction “Welcome to the Gulag,” his unapologetic commentary about how cellphones and the internet have extended television’s reach, eroding intelligence and freedom and creating a legion of bloodshot eyed zombies unable to communicate beyond their screens or think for themselves.
  
 Provocative and prescient, irreverent and insightful, Ellison’s critical analyses of the glowing box that became the center of American life are even more relevant in the twenty-first century.

I spent the day in Melbourne with nothing but my Leica M9. Although I packed a few lenses, I mainly used the 50mm Summilux ASPH.

I remember reading a lot of magazines, books, weblogs and also online videos, when asked who they would like to photograph along, most of photographers would throw out big names in the photography history.

While I look up to a lot of photographers, established or even new comers, while I admire the work of many, the one person that I really want to shoot along is my father.

We share the same passion for photography, actually I must say that I got it from him, we even use the same gears (again I walk on his footsteps) I just realised that we never had or took the opportunity to shoot together. Actually once. If I am asked which photographer I would like to shoot along with? I will say: “my Dad.”"

In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as captivating and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive. This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.

Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.

Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders."

A must read for anyone who wants to work in Hollywood or just know how Hollywood works.”
   — The Hollywood Reporter

A New York Times bestseller, now updated with an afterword and exclusive new material

From the #1 bestselling author behind acclaimed oral histories of Saturday Night Live and ESPN comes ""the most hotly anticipated book [in decades]"" (Variety): James Andrew Miller's irresistible insider chronicle of the modern entertainment industry, told through the epic story of Creative Artists Agency (CAA)—the ultimate power player that has represented the world's biggest stars and shaped the landscape of film, television, comedy, music, and sports.

Started in 1975, when five bright and brash upstarts left creaky William Morris to form their own innovative talent agency, CAA would come to revolutionize Hollywood, representing everyone from Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, and Steven Spielberg to Jennifer Lawrence, J.J. Abrams, Will Smith, and Brad Pitt. Over the next decades its tentacles would spread aggressively into sports, advertising, and digital media. Powerhouse is the fascinating, no-holds-barred saga of that ascent. Drawing on unprecedented and exclusive access to the men and women who built and battled with CAA—including co-founders Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer and rivals like Ari Emanuel of William Morris Endeavor—as well as the stars themselves, Miller spins a unique and unforgettable tale of brilliance, ambition, betrayal, and outrageous success."

This blank and rash statement is made that it may be rejected. But first let it be understood that I do not mean it is a better written work than the Birds or the Frogs, or that (to descend to the scale of values that will be naturally imputed to me) it has any more appeal to the collectors of “curious literature” than the Ecclesiazusae or the Thesmophoriazusae. On the mere grounds of taste I can see an at least equally good case made out for the Birds. That brightly plumaged fantasy has an aerial wit and colour all its own. But there are certain works in which a man finds himself at an angle of vision where there is an especially felicitous union of the aesthetic and emotional elements which constitute the basic qualities of his uniqueness. We recognize these works as being welded into a strange unity, as having a homogeneous texture of ecstasy over them that surpasses any aesthetic surface of harmonic colour, though that harmony also is understood by the deeper welling of imagery from the core of creative exaltation. And I think that this occurs in Lysistrata."

_______________________________

Jim, from Queensland Australia, is a full-time Forex Trader and currently resides in Vietnam.

This book provides a reliable and robust trading method which he has refined over many months on both demo and live trading.  Jim uses the popular MetaTrader platforms to trade.  These are more commonly referred to as MT4 or MT5, and there are many reputable brokers who offer these platforms.

As mentioned above, the method is now also available to be traded on the very popular web-based TradingView platform.

Although Jim concentrates solely on Forex trading, there is no reason why you could not trade this method on other financial instruments offered by many brokers.  These may include:
OilPrecious metalsCommoditiesStock indicesIndividual stocksCryptocurrencies
You may not wish to conduct your actual trading off the Metatrader or TradingView platforms, however as this method relies on the use of Jim's custom indicators which he had specifically built for Metatrader and TradingView, you will need to at least download a free MT4/MT5 or TV demonstration platform  to enable you to conduct your trade analysis, and then place your actual trades on your preferred Broker's platform.

The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is the classic guide to getting smart about the market. Legendary mutual fund  pioneer John C. Bogle reveals his key to getting more out of investing: low-cost index funds. Bogle describes the simplest and most effective investment strategy for building wealth over the long term: buy and hold, at very low cost, a mutual fund that tracks a broad stock market Index such as the S&P 500.

While the stock market has tumbled and then soared since the first edition of Little Book of Common Sense was published in April 2007, Bogle’s investment principles have endured and served investors well.  This tenth anniversary edition includes updated data and new information but maintains the same long-term perspective as in its predecessor. 

Bogle has also added two new chapters designed to provide further guidance to investors:  one on asset allocation, the other on retirement investing.

A portfolio focused on index funds is the only investment that effectively guarantees your fair share of stock market returns. This strategy is favored by Warren Buffett, who said this about Bogle: “If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds. . . . Today, however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.”

Bogle shows you how to make index investing work for you and help you achieve your financial goals, and finds support from some of the world's best financial minds: not only Warren Buffett, but Benjamin Graham, Paul Samuelson, Burton Malkiel, Yale’s David Swensen, Cliff Asness of AQR, and many others.

This new edition of The Little Book of Common Sense Investing offers you the same solid strategy as its predecessor for building your financial future.
 Build a broadly diversified, low-cost portfolio without the risks of individual stocks, manager selection, or sector rotation. Forget the fads and marketing hype, and focus on what works in the real world. Understand that stock returns are generated by three sources (dividend yield, earnings growth, and change in market valuation) in order to establish rational expectations for stock returns over the coming decade. Recognize that in the long run, business reality  trumps market expectations. Learn how to harness the magic of compounding returns while avoiding the tyranny of compounding costs.  
While index investing allows you to sit back and let the market do the work for you, too many investors trade frantically, turning a winner’s game into a loser’s game. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is a solid guidebook to your financial future."

Our culture feeds us the lie that it’s impossible to become a millionaire in America today, but it’s time you heard the truth.


In his newest book, Everyday Millionaires: How Ordinary People Built Extraordinary Wealth—and How You Can Too, Chris Hogan destroys millionaire myths that are keeping everyday people from achieving financial independence. Chris and the Ramsey research team surveyed over 10,000 US millionaires, discovering how these high-net-worth people reached their financial status. And the formula might surprise you.


Millionaire status doesn’t require inheriting a bunch of money or having a high-paying job. No. The path to becoming a millionaire is paved with more-ordinary tools—tools that you either already have or that you can learn. If you thought you could never become a millionaire, think again. Listen and learn from over 10,000 everyday millionaires who have done it and believe it’s possible for you too."

 Few designers have stayed on top of changing trends the way Tommy Hilfiger has. Fewer still have left such an indelible mark on global culture. Since designing his first collection of “classics with a twist” three decades ago, Tommy Hilfiger has been synonymous with all-American style—but his destiny wasn’t always so clear. Growing up one of nine children in a working-class family in Elmira, New York, Tommy suffered from dyslexia, flunked sophomore year of high school, and found himself constantly at odds with his father. Nevertheless, this self-described dreamer had a vision and the relentless will to make it a reality. At eighteen he opened his own clothing store, parlaying his uncanny instinct for style into a budding career as a fashion designer. Through decades of triumph and turmoil, Tommy remained doggedly optimistic. To this day, his approach to commerce is rooted in his positive view of the world.

American Dreamer brims with anecdotes that cover Tommy’s years as a club kid and scrappy entrepreneur in 1970s New York as well as unique insights into the exclusive A-list personalities with whom he’s collaborated and interacted, from Mick Jagger and David Bowie to Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein. But this is more than just a fashion icon’s memoir—it’s a road map for building a brand, both professionally and personally. Tommy takes us behind the scenes of every decision—and every mistake—he’s ever made, offering advice on leadership, business, team-building, and creativity. 

This is the story of a true American original, told for the first time in his own words, with honesty, humor, and the insatiable appetite for life and style that proves that sometimes you have to dream big to make it big.

Praise for American Dreamer

“A unique look into the fashion world . . . an honest, straightforward, mostly entertaining autobiography of the man who created a classic yet hip line of clothing.”—Kirkus Reviews

 “Fashionistas and business gurus alike will glean important lessons from Hilfiger’s rags-to-riches rag-trade story.”—Booklist

 “Tommy burst onto the fashion scene at the height of hip-hop and was instantly taken up by rappers and rockers alike. Since then, year after year he has been ahead of the curve with his elegant and stylish looks. His creative energy has always been an inspiration to me. He’s really himself in American Dreamer.”—Mick Jagger

""In American Dreamer Tommy shows how he has taken the (rock) stars and the (preppy) stripes and come up with a look—and a label—that are recognized globally as being quintessentially American, as well as a brand that constantly keeps time with pop music.”—Anna Wintour

 “Tommy is an inspiration to many people. American Dreamer shows how he has managed to be successful in business and done so with integrity.”—David Beckham 

 “Tommy is one of the most genuine people I know! In American Dreamer you can feel his passion pour through everything he does: fashion, fatherhood, family, and friendship!”—Alicia Keys

 “Tommy Hilfiger is an American icon who was able to transcend fashion and blend it with pop culture and take it to a worldwide audience. American Dreamer documents how, unlike any other designer, Tommy was able to tap into music, its subculture, and its influence on society.”—Tommy Mottola"

Included among his many contributions is his path-breaking work on entrepreneurship—of the quintessential characteristics of all market economies.


His timeless phrase describing the entrepreneurial process as one of “creative destruction” is likely second only to Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” in its daily use in popular tweets, blog posts, speeches, and articles. Renowned Chicago economist Jacob Viner praised Schumpeter’s History of Economic Analysis as “by a wide margin… the most brilliant contribution to the history of analytical phases of our discipline which has ever been made”. However, it is Schumpeter’s Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, in which Schumpeter describes the mechanisms—entrepreneurs, innovation, and capital reallocation—that drive the “incessant” recreation of capitalism that is by far his most popular and successful work."

If you've ever experienced one of Joe's workshops or seminars, you know he's a fantastic teacher, and this book is an extension of that. While he does write about the basics of photography, if you know Joe, you know that he's found a way to work his own sense of humor and familiarity in with all the nuts and bolts to make it an entertaining read."" 


Thousands of photo fans agreed, and eagerly joined Joe on his happy journey through the pixelated world of modern-day photography. In so doing, they learned from one of LIFE's master shooters-in fact, the final in the long line of distinguished LIFE staff photographers-who encouraged them that, with a little preparation and care, with a dash of enthusiasm and daring, anyone can make a better photo: Anyone can turn a ""keeper"" into a treasure.


It has since become clear to Joe and the editors of LIFE that their Guide to Digital Photography was built to last-that its tips and tone had struck a chord with photography enthusiasts everywhere. One thing it wasn't, however, was built to fit in your camera bag when you were heading into the field. Now it is! Here's the digest-sized version, filled with the same wonderful collection of McNally photography, beautifully illustrating the points Joe is making.

That is an understatement. I used to talk with prospects on and on and on, afraid to close. I thought if I kept the conversation going long enough, they would eventually volunteer their ""yes"" decision.


Of course, that never happened.


So, in my lifelong quest to avoid rejection, I had to find new and effective closes that work.


Here are 46 years' worth of our best closes. All of these closes are kind and comfortable for prospects, and rejection-free for us. Here are just a few of the closes you will learn and love:


* The million-dollar close.

* Managing the decision-making funnel.

* Having prospects close themselves.

* Removing risk and uncertainty.

* Making objection-solving easy in seconds.

* And of course, many strategies to quickly remove the “I need to think it over” objection.


Old-school closing is old news. In today's world, prospects are over-exposed to marketing and are sales-resistant. 


Use these closes to help our prospects move forward and say “yes” to our offers.


Not every close is perfect for every prospect. We want a variety of closes. Let’s choose which close is best for our prospects, and most natural for us.


Never be afraid of closing again. In fact, we will look forward to closing. Happy times ahead!

Beginning in 1987, as she embarks on an affair that she knows will be all-consuming, and ending in 1995 with the publication of The First Stone and the furore that followed it, Garner reveals the inner life of a woman in love and a great writer at work.

With devastating honesty and sparkling humour, she grapples with what it means for her sense of self to be so entwined with another—how to survive as an artist in a partnership that is both enthralling and uncompromising. And through it all we see the elevating, and grounding, power of work and the enduring value of friendship.

Helen Garner writes novels, stories, screenplays and works of non-fiction. In 2006 she received the inaugural Melbourne Prize for Literature, and in 2016 she won the prestigious Windham–Campbell Literature Prize for non-fiction and the Western Australian Premier’s Book Award. In 2019 she was honoured with the Australia Council Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature. Her books include Monkey Grip, The Children’s Bach, Cosmo Cosmolino, The Spare Room, The First Stone, This House of Grief, Everywhere I Look and Yellow Notebook.

‘Garner is scrupulous, painstaking, and detailed, with sharp eyes and ears. She is everywhere at once, watching and listening, a recording angel at life’s secular apocalypses…her unillusioned eye makes her clarity compulsive.’ New Yorker

‘On the page, Garner is uncommonly fierce, though this usually has the effect on me of making her seem all the more likeable. I relish her fractious, contrarian streak – she wears it as a chef would a bloody apron – even as I worry about what it would be like to have to face it down.’ Guardian"

Gok grew up on a Leicester housing estate, with a loving family who ran a Chinese restaurant. For his parents, food meant love - and Gok was so well loved that by the time he was a teenager he weighed 21 stone. Being Asian and gay as well, Gok felt lonely and out of place. He was an easy target for bullies and suffered terribly at their hands. 

In a moment of inspiration, he decided to reinvent himself with his first style makeover and a larger-than-life personality to go with it. But his next move was to lose a devastating ten stone in nine months. In Through Thick and Thin, for the first time, Gok reveals all about that life changing period. 

The lessons Gok learnt during this time helped him bounce back to become a stylist to the stars, every woman's best friend and a national treasure. In this intimate memoir Gok tells his full story in his own words. Whether he's recounting the horrors of childhood bullying or riotous anecdotes about his loving family, behind the scenes in the fashion world or TV shows, Gok's voice jumps off the page with all the honesty, wit and warmth we've come to know and love him for."

To Banish Sloppiness... we first have to recognize just how sloppy we are.  You don't just learn this and then become perfect and precise in one fell swoop.  It is a life long journey.  There will still be mountains of sloppiness and waste everywhere and in everything you do.  But what is important is that you begin the journey today.  My hope and prayer is that this book might begin a journey in your life that creates greater fulfillment and respect for the abundance and blessings we have all been given.  Remember, it's not about perfection.  It's about starting the journey to perfection.  This is the joy I experience every day, knowing that I am more thoughtful of the gifts that I have been given.  Being wasteful benefits no one... but being thoughtful benefits everyone."

 Television is not what it once was. Award-winning author and critic Clive James spent decades covering the medium, and witnessed a radical change in content, format, and programming, and in the very manner in which TV is watched.
  
 Here he examines this unique cultural revolution, providing a brilliant, eminently entertaining analysis of many of television’s most notable twenty-first-century accomplishments and their not always subtle impact on modern society—including such acclaimed serial dramas as Breaking Bad, The West Wing, Mad Men, and The Sopranos and the comedy 30 Rock. With intelligence and wit, James explores a television landscape expanded by cable and broadband and profoundly altered by the advent of Netflix, Amazon, and other cord-cutting platforms that have helped to usher in a golden age of unabashed binge-watching.
  
 “James loves television, he loves the winding stories it tells and that we share them together. Play All is a late love letter to the medium of our lives.”—Sunday Times
  
 “Large-brained and largehearted, and written with astonishing energy.”—The New York Times Book Review

You’ll discover the five people you should look for and the four best places to grow, learn, practice, and perform so you can step into the role you were created to fill.

After reading The Proximity Principle, you’ll know how to connect with the right people and put yourself in the right places, so opportunities will come―and you’ll be prepared to take them."

Q. How do you make a small fortune in the stock market?
A. Start with a large one.
A prime example of the Indian stock market’s potential is Infosys. If you subscribed to 100 shares of Infosys at its 1993 IPO at a price of INR 95 per share, you would own 1,02,400 shares of the company today. At an average price of INR 700 per share, that investment would now be worth over INR 7 Crores!

Introduction:
Taxmann’s Stock Market Wisdom highlights the great potential of the stock market while guiding investors to invest wisely and how to avoid its pitfalls. It is an attempt to assist investors to understand the following:
• How the market system operates?
• How one should invest money in it?
• How one can generate wealth through it over the long term.

The author has also explained how the markets have evolved, what their present stage is, where they’re headed, and, of course, how you can benefit, with the help of multiple case studies.
• Featuring the following case-studies:
𝚘 India’s Top 25 Years Return Chart
𝚘 World stock exchange performance
𝚘 The Roller Coaster Journey of the SENSEX from 100 to 41,000
𝚘 Amazing story of Reliance Industries – The first Indian company to enter the 10 Trillion Market Cap Club
𝚘 Avenue Supermarts Ltd. – The company that defies gravity

Seus capítulos denunciam as consequências sociais dos cortes de gastos e mostram como o discurso da austeridade fiscal é ideológico, falacioso e dogmático.

Além disso, o livro aponta para o futuro e propõe uma nova agenda econômica para o país que reafirma os direitos sociais, o papel do Estado no provimento desses direitos e a política fiscal como ferramenta para o crescimento, preservação ambiental, redução das desigualdades sociais, regionais, raciais e de gênero, em direção a um projeto de desenvolvimento transformador da realidade brasileira."

CASHFLOW Quadrant was written for those who are ready to move beyond job security and enter the world of financial freedom. It’s for those who want to make significant changes in their lives and take control of their financial future.

Robert believes that the reason most people struggle financially is because they've been spent years in school but were never been taught about money. Robert’s rich dad taught him that this lack of financial education is why so many people work so hard all their lives for money… instead of learning how to make money work for them.

The plot centers on the barbarian protagonist as she finds her position in the Greek world threatened, and the revenge she takes against her husband Jason, who has betrayed her for another woman, by killing her own children.


Euripides was one of the three great tragedians of classical Athens. He is identified with theatrical innovations that have profoundly influenced drama down to modern times, especially in the representation of traditional, mythical heroes as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. He was also unique among the writers of ancient Athens for the sympathy he demonstrated towards all victims of society, including women."

In the distant future the United States has been split into two regions separated by a barren wasteland; this is the country of Dystopia. Here the individual is discouraged, freedom is an illusion, food is rationed, and everything you do is tracked by a chip implanted in your arm. This is Dana Ginary’s world.

At age seventeen, people receive their career assignments chosen for them by a government body. Forced to work at the Waste Management Plant because she was declared too individualistic, Dana finds herself surrounded by death and brutality. Knowing her days are numbered, she looks for a way to leave the plant before she, too, becomes one of its causalities.
It is then she meets a man named George and soon finds herself caught up in a cat and mouse game between the resistance and the Dystopian government. Dana finds herself faced with an agonizing choice of whom she will betray and whom she will save: her friend George, her parents, or herself.

If consumers make decisions unconsciously, why do we persist in asking them directly through traditional marketing research why they do what they do? They simply can't tell us because they don't really know. Before marketers develop strategies, they need to recognize that consumers have strategies too . . .human strategies, not consumer strategies. We need to go beyond asking why, and begin to ask how,behavior change occurs. Here, author DouglasVan Praet takes the most brilliant and revolutionary concepts from cognitive science and applies them to how we market, advertise, and consume in the modern digital age. Van Praet simplifies the most complex object in the known universe - the human brain - into seven codified actionable steps to behavior change. These steps are illustrated using real world examples from advertising, marketing, media and business to consciously unravel what brilliant marketers and ad practitioners have long done intuitively, deconstructing the real story behind some of the greatest marketing and business successes in recent history, such as Nike's ""Just Do It"" campaign; ""Got Milk?""; Wendy's ""Where's the Beef?"" ;and the infamous Volkswagen ""Punch Buggy"" launch as well as their beloved ""The Force"" (Mini Darth Vader) Super Bowl commercial."

We tend to think of burnout as a problem we can solve with self-care: more yoga, better breathing techniques, and more resilience. But evidence is mounting that applying personal, Band-Aid solutions to an epic and rapidly evolving workplace phenomenon isn't enough—in fact, it's not even close. If we're going to solve this problem, organizations must take the lead in developing an antiburnout strategy that moves beyond apps, wellness programs, and perks.

In this eye-opening, paradigm-shifting, and practical guide, Jennifer Moss lays bare the real causes of burnout and how organizations can stop the chronic stress cycle that an alarming number of workers suffer through. The Burnout Epidemic explains:
What causes burnout—and what organizations can do to prevent itWhy traditional wellness initiatives fall shortHow companies can build an antiburnout strategy based on prevention, not perksHow leaders can measure burnout in their own organizationsWhat leaders can do to develop a healthier culture that prioritizes resilience and curiosity
As the pandemic has shown, self-care is important, but it's not a cure-all for burnout. Employers need to do more. With fascinating research, new findings from the pandemic, and interviews with business leaders around the globe, The Burnout Epidemic offers readers insightful and actionable advice that will empower them to help themselves—and their employees—feel healthier and happier at work."

 Given the choice, Pam Mandel would say no and stay home. It was getting her nowhere, so she decided to say yes. Yes to hard work and hitch-hiking, to mean boyfriends and dirty travel, to unfolding the map and walking to its edges. Yes to unknown countries, night shifts, language lessons, bad decisions, to anything to make her feel real, visible, alive.

 A product of beige California suburbs, Mandel was overlooked and unexceptional. When her father ships her off on a youth group tour of Israel, he inadvertently catapults his seventeen-year-old daughter into a world of angry European backpackers, seize-the-day Israelis, and the fall out of cold war-era politics. Border violence hadn't been on the birthright tour agenda. But then neither had domestic violence, going broke, getting wasted, getting sick, or getting lost.

 With no guidance and no particular plan, utterly unprepared for what lies ahead, Mandel says yes to everything and everyone, embarking on an adventure across three continents and thousands of miles, from a cold water London flat to rural Pakistan, from the Nile River Delta to the snowy peaks of Ladakh and finally, back home to California, determined to shape a life that is truly hers.
 An extraordinary memoir of going away and growing up, The Same River Twice follows Mandel's tangled journey and shows how travel teaches and changes us, even while it helps us become exactly who we have been all along."

 When Martin G. Moore was asked to rescue a leading energy corporation from ever-increasing debt and a lack of executive accountability, he faced an uphill battle. Not only had he never before stepped into the role of CEO; he also had no experience in the rapidly evolving energy sector. Relying on the practical leadership principles he had honed throughout his thirty-three-year career, he overhauled the company’s culture, redefined its leadership capability, and increased earnings by a compound annual growth rate of 125 percent.

He sweeps away the mystical fog surrounding leadership today and lays out the essential steps for success. Moore combines this tangible advice with honest, real-world examples from his own career to provide a no-nonsense look at the skills a true leader possesses.
  
 Moore’s principles for no b******t leadership focus on:
  
 ·       Creating value by focusing only on the things that matter most
 ·       Facing conflict, adversity, and ambiguity with decisiveness and confidence
 ·       Setting uncompromising standards for behavior and performance
 ·       Selecting and developing great people
 ·       Making those people accountable, and empowering them to do their best
 ·       Setting simple, value-driven goals and communicating them relentlessly

In today’s digital age, the traditional sales funnel—marketing at the top, sales in the middle, customer service at the bottom—is no longer effective. To be successful, businesses must obsess over the questions, concerns, and problems their buyers have, and address them as honestly and as thoroughly as possible. Every day, buyers turn to search engines to ask billions of questions. Having the answers they need can attract thousands of potential buyers to your company—but only if your content strategy puts your answers at the top of those search results. It’s a simple and powerful equation that produces growth and success: They Ask, You Answer. 

Using these principles, author Marcus Sheridan led his struggling pool company from the bleak depths of the housing crash of 2008 to become one of the largest pool installers in the United States. Discover how his proven strategy can work for your business and master the principles of inbound and content marketing that have empowered thousands of companies to achieve exceptional growth.

They Ask, You Answer is a straightforward guide filled with practical tactics and insights for transforming your marketing strategy. This new edition has been fully revised and updated to reflect the evolution of content marketing and the increasing demands of today’s internet-savvy buyers. New chapters explore the impact of technology, conversational marketing, the essential elements every business website should possess, the rise of video, and new stories from companies that have achieved remarkable results with They Ask, You Answer. 

Upon reading this book, you will know:
 How to build trust with buyers through content and video. How to turn your web presence into a magnet for qualified buyers. What works and what doesn’t through new case studies, featuring real-world results from companies that have embraced these principles.

It wasn’t just its exhaustive rounds of hearings around the country — Melbourne, Brisbane, Darwin, and Sydney — on topics from farming finance to financial planning. It wasn’t even the long list of scandals exposed to a horrified nation — charging fees to dead people, blatant conflicts of interest, and taking $1 billion from customers in fees that banks were never entitled to.

What made it so fascinating, so heart-breaking, and so enraging was the procession of faces through the witness box, and the team of counsel gazing into the dark heart of banking.

Tearful victims, blank-faced executives, hapless regulators, and a couple of utter charlatans all had their day in court, watched by an audience of millions, and revealing — in their stories — the material to justify re-shaping the multi-trillion dollar financial services industry that forms a pillar of Australian life.

A Wunch of Bankers covers not just the big shocks, but the small moments — lost in the flurry of daily reporting — that reveal how companies have used the law, limp enforcement, and basic human behaviour to take advantage of customers.

Is there a phrase that judges how much life-insurance spruikers in call centres can terrify you about your impending death — and the grief-stricken ruins of an estate you’ll leave for your bereaved family — while still being legal?

Yes, there is.

Was there a meeting in which a bank’s executives ignored a warning of “Extreme” from its chief risk officer, to embark on an illegal scheme that accrued $3.6 billion in funds?

There was.

Mixed among the testimony are snippets from life on the road as the World’s Oldest Debuting TV Reporter — not just driving five hours one-way to talk to a man who almost blew his brains out over a bank nabbing his $22 million estate, but explaining how journalism can only ever give you a glimpse inside complex issues.

In A Wunch of Bankers, Daniel Ziffer bring out the colour and grit of the royal commission’s proceedings, and explores broader issues raised by the testimony. A mixture of analysis, reportage, and observations, it is densely researched and compellingly written."

Are you ready?

In business, especially today, you are only as successful as your next career transition. Do well, and you'll be on the fast track to even more challenging roles. Fail, and you could irreparably harm your career--and your organization.

In his international bestseller The First 90 Days, transition guru Michael D. Watkins outlined a set of basic principles for getting up to speed quickly in new professional roles. Since that book was published Watkins has worked with thousands of leaders, helping them to accelerate their transitions. These leaders posed challenging questions on how to apply the basic principles in real-life situations. The truth that emerged: the First 90 Days framework can be applied in every transition, but the way you apply it is entirely different when you have been promoted to a higher level than it is when you are joining a new organization or taking a role in a different country.

Master Your Next Move answers a distinct need, focusing on the most common types of transitions leaders face and the unique challenges posed by each. Based on years of research, and now with a new introduction, this indispensable book explores eight crucial transitions virtually everyone encounters during their career, including promotion, leading former peers, onboarding into a new company, making an international move, and turning around a business in crisis.

With real-world examples and many practical models and tools, Master Your Next Move is your guide to surviving and thriving as you make your next move . . . and every one after that."

The body of work featured in this book are genuine photographs. They have been neither doctored up nor altered. They are in fact the actual prints of the image captured by the objective.

 

Dani Olivier creates his effects at the time of the shoots, by projecting complex images and intricate light patterns on his models. He never touches up the originals.

 

The models are nude. They do not wear enhancing accessories.

Their makeup is minimal.

 

The pictures are taken with a black background. There are no artifacts:

just the models and the light projections. The projections are either abstract or figurative.

The final composition is always surreal.

 

Dani Olivier’s abstract and psychedelic nudes are his exclusive creations.

 

They confer a new dimension and innovative approach to the art of nude photography."

Most actors only learn short monologues for auditions. Equally, most monologues you come across are written expressly for this purpose, with a typical duration of 1-3 minutes. Longer monologues – from 5-10 minutes and onwards – aren’t all that easy to find and the majority of actors don’t know one by heart.

This is not a good thing. There’s no excuse for an actor not to have at least one comedic and one dramatic monologue ready to go at all times. From a career perspective, it’s beyond undesirable if they don’t – it’s borderline negligent.

Why such a strong statement?

An actor who doesn’t have monologues in their repertoire is like a musician who doesn’t know any songs. They might be good at what they do but it will be hard for them to prove it.

Monologues provide an opportunity for an actor to showcase their work, putting them alone in the spotlight to demonstrate just how good they are. They are not designed for auditions, which are usually done in front of a small panel; they are designed for performance, meaning they are something you can put in front of an audience of any size. They are easily transportable, rarely being dependent on props and costumes (since we have mime and imagination to compensate) and never reliant on other actors being around. There are many thousands of festivals around the world which produce monologues, providing a platform for any actor who wants an audience. A monologue is the perfect vehicle for you to show off your stuff.

On top of that, many drama students around the world are required to perform monologues as part of their schooling and it’s incredibly difficult to find well-written pieces which are longer than 2-3 minutes.

As a playwright, International Literary Manager, and former Festival Director of the world’s largest short play festival (Short+Sweet Sydney), I know for sure there is a great market need for quality monologues. Quite simply, it’s hard to find good ones. There are many out there but they’re often weak on story and character, therefore not providing the raw materials an actor needs to shine. I had an epiphany when actor after actor told me they struggled to find a piece they liked: I realised I could help them!

So I moved the focus of my writing away from novels and full-length plays and onto monologues, emphasising rich characters and original, engaging stories that stay with you well after the performance. That said, actors thrive when they’re having fun on stage, so there are also a few “silly” pieces in here which are simply designed to make people laugh.

I’ve been fortunate enough to have these monologues produced over 600 times around the world and win 19 major awards from them. What’s more, 17 actors have won major awards from performing them. As my main aim is for people to enjoy watching and performing them, I’m glad to be on the right track.

For this volume, I’ve collated my best 30 pieces for you. Drama, comedy, male monologues, female monologues, gender-neutral monologues, good silly fun and dark serious stuff – this book has it all. All ages, races, genders, sizes, and personalities are catered for. And it’s formatted for performance so you can print the scripts and start rehearsing.

Do yourself a favour. Learn one of these pieces. The next time someone says, “So you’re an actor eh? Show me what you can do,” you’ll know exactly what to show them."

""This book blew my mind. More importantly, it made financial independence seem achievable. I read Financial Freedom three times, cover-to-cover."" 
 —Lifehacker

Money is unlimited. Time is not. Become financially independent as fast as possible.

In 2010, 24-year old Grant Sabatier woke up to find he had $2.26 in his bank account. Five years later, he had a net worth of over $1.25 million, and CNBC began calling him ""the Millennial Millionaire."" By age 30, he had reached financial independence. Along the way he uncovered that most of the accepted wisdom about money, work, and retirement is either incorrect, incomplete, or so old-school it's obsolete.

Financial Freedom is a step-by-step path to make more money in less time, so you have more time for the things you love. It challenges the accepted narrative of spending decades working a traditional 9 to 5 job, pinching pennies, and finally earning the right to retirement at age 65, and instead offers readers an alternative: forget everything you've ever learned about money so that you can actually live the life you want.

Sabatier offers surprising, counter-intuitive advice on topics such as how to:

*  Create profitable side hustles that you can turn into passive income streams or full-time businesses
*  Save money without giving up what makes you happy
*  Negotiate more out of your employer than you thought possible
*  Travel the world for less
*  Live for free--or better yet, make money on your living situation
*  Create a simple, money-making portfolio that only needs minor adjustments
*  Think creatively--there are so many ways to make money, but we don't see them.

But most importantly, Sabatier highlights that, while one's ability to make money is limitless, one's time is not. There's also a limit to how much you can save, but not to how much money you can make. No one should spend precious years working at a job they dislike or worrying about how to make ends meet. Perhaps the biggest surprise: You need less money to ""retire"" at age 30 than you do at age 65.

Financial Freedom is not merely a laundry list of advice to follow to get rich quick--it's a practical roadmap to living life on one's own terms, as soon as possible."

•Create something with nothing by understanding how to exchange value using a “social spread”
•Build a “vertical network” instead of a “horizontal network” (a.k.a frenemy zone) which may be limiting your career

Too many books discuss the same people, same companies, and same concepts, resulting in cliché advice. One of the main reasons behind this phenomenon is due to the fact that so many books on business and professional development are written by authors with limited professional experience or are written by authors who share similar backgrounds. Furthermore, too many successful professionals lack writing experience, resulting in books that may have great content but poor narration.

Kevin Hong, who is a columnist for Inc. Magazine, not only shares his experience working in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, but also interviews and shares his experience working with high profile executives and entrepreneurs who have built their companies to nine or ten figures as well as Hollywood celebrities, YouTube celebrities, a former NBA star, and even a politician to share the most unorthodox ways of winning in one’s career and business. 

Some of his highlights include working on a start-up lesson video which included Justin Kan, who sold his company Twitch for $1 billion, and other Silicon Valley elites as well as advising on film distribution for the film ‘The 60 Yard-Line, which featured notable celebrities such as Randall Park and Chuck Liddell. He also managed to squeeze in an interview with Psy’s adviser from Korea who helped Psy bridge a partnership with Scooter Braun, Justin Bieber’s manager, to help make Gangnam Style into the viral video it became. 

Hong, who is now a C-Level executive of a subsidiary of a publicly traded company, built his last start-up up to a $15 million valuation, and has shared his business advice by contributing articles for CNBC, Forbes, Huffington Post, Inc., Film Journal, Korea’s Maeil news and various media outlets. The book, which is written in a unique style, does not try to “teach” you another lesson. The goal of the book is to illustrate “The Outlier Approach” by bringing in the reader into the experience opposed to explaining business concepts in a long drawn out lecture style. The book has an emphasis on character development and conflict in order to explain the “why” and “how” when certain strategies need to be applied in one’s career. 

Ultimately, if you are not interested in walking a straight line or following text book directions to succeed in your career, this book is for you. This book is for the oddballs, misfits, outliers, rebels, and nonconformists in all of us."

Money—investing, personal finance, and business decisions—is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.



In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important topics."

Este livro não foi feito para ser apenas lido. Ele foi escrito para ser relido diariamente. Foi feito para ser um manual de trabalho e que deveria ser incorporado às ferramentas diárias de trabalho de todos os vendedores que desejam, ou precisam vender, todos os dias, sempre.



O que é necessário para se tornar um sucesso em vendas?



Leia e releia este livro!



Porque este livro é vermelho?



VERMELHO é a cor da paixão.

Paixão é o ponto fundamental da venda.

Sem paixão não há vendas.



VERMELHO é a cor do amor.

Se você não ama o que vende, venda outra coisa.



VERMELHO é a cor mais viva.

Você deve ser vivo para converter a venda em compra.



VERMELHO é a cor que mais chama a atenção

Você deve chamar a atenção de seus clientes, transmitindo uma mensagem de valor, e não apenas fazendo um discurso de vendas.



E VERMELHO é fogo.

Se você não estiver ""em chamas"", perderá para alguém que está.



Todos esses atributos do VERMELHO devem estar presentes em um vendedor, pois são fatores fundamentais para o sucesso. Quem não adorar vendas, não tiver paixão, não estiver em chamas, perderá a venda para alguém que esteja assim."

Yet 30% of all new businesses in Australia fail before their first year is finished; in the US 44% of enterprises have closed their doors by the 3rd year.


Why do some entrepreneurs succeed while others struggle to realise their dream? 


Phillip Di Bella began Di Bella Coffee in 2002 with $5000 in his pocket. Within 4 years the company had made BRW’s Top 100 Fastest Growing list, with Phillip named among the top 100 young rich. 


Phillip has turned his knowledge of coffee into a multi-million dollar business, yet his ambitions and dreams were no different than the thousands who dream of an empire and embark on their own journey every year to achieve success. 


This book is about the formula that drove his success; the same formula which we believe drives the success of every great entrepreneur. That formula is simply called entrepreneurial intelligence. It is required reading for any entrepreneur who wants to survive the cut, and prosper."

Written when Covid struck, the book is edgy and unrestrained. Some of it is undoubtably defamatory. Grafton ignored his lawyers advice and turned to self-publishing since the big publishers would not touch it.

Customarily, merchants have had to tie up vast amounts of capital when acquiring stock. But, this is unnecessary if you use dropshipping.  

With a dropshipping model, there is no need to purchase a product without you already having made the sale, and having been paid by your customer. Devoid of substantial up-front inventory investments, it is very possible to begin a thriving dropshipping business without minimal financial backup.

It’s Easy to StartRunning e-commerce businesses is easier when you don't have to deal with handling physical products. When you dropship, you have no worries about
•Paying for, or managing a warehouse
•Packing and shipping your customers’ orders
•Tracking the inventory for accounting purposes
•Handling inbound shipments or any returns, physically
•Repeatedly ordering products and maintaining stock levels
•Needing a storage place to hold physical products

Low OverheadsBecause there is no reason to deal with purchasing any inventory or the management of a warehouse, your overheads and businesses expenses can be quite small. Many successful dropshipping companies are run from home offices with a single computer for less than $100 per month. As your business grows, it’s likely these expenses will increase, but nonetheless, they will still be low when compared to traditional brick-and-mortar companies.

Dropshipping businesses can be run from almost anywhere as long as you have an internet connection. This is vital to allow communication with your suppliers and your customers, both quickly and efficiently. Many successful online stores are run by people when they live outside of their home country, too.

Because there is no need to pre-purchase any items you sell, you can offer a broader array of products to potential customers. So, if your supplier stocks a certain product, you can list it for sale in your online store, or on the platform you use, at no additional cost.

With conventional business types, if you have orders for three times as much business, it is likely you'll need to perform three times as much work. With the leveraging of dropshipping suppliers, the majority of the work in processing additional orders is borne by your suppliers. This allows you to expand your business with fewer growing pains. Sales growth always brings some extra work. In most cases, this is primarily related to customer service. Companies that exploit dropshipping as a necessity, scale exceptionally well, especially when compared to conventional e-commerce businesses.  All of these benefits make dropshipping an advantageous and efficient model to both new and established merchants, alike. Regrettably, dropshipping isn't always a bed of roses, though. All this convenience and flexibility comes with a few disadvantages. Let’s shed some light on these."

The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money [1936]


THIS book is chiefly addressed to my fellow economists. I hope that it will be intelligible to others. But its main purpose is to deal with difficult questions of theory, and only in the second place with the applications of this theory to practice. For if orthodox economics is at fault, the error is to be found not in the superstructure, which has been erected with great care for logical consistency, but in a lack of clearness and of generality in the premisses. Thus I cannot achieve my object of persuading economists to re-examine critically certain of their basic assumptions except by a highly abstract argument and also by much controversy. I wish there could have been less of the latter. But I have thought it important, not only to explain my own point of view, but also to show in what respects it departs from the prevailing theory. Those, who are strongly wedded to what I shall call “the classical theory”, will fluctuate, I expect, between a belief that I am quite wrong and a belief that I am saying nothing new. It is for others to determine if either of these or the third alternative is right. My controversial passages are aimed at providing some material for an answer; and I must ask forgiveness if, in the pursuit of sharp distinctions, my controversy is itself too keen. I myself held with conviction for many years the theories which I now attack, and I am not, I think, ignorant of their strong points.


The matters at issue are of an importance which cannot be exaggerated. But, if my explanations are right, it is my fellow economists, not the general public, whom I must first convince. At this stage of the argument the general public, though welcome at the debate, are only eavesdroppers at an attempt by an economist to bring to an issue the deep divergences of opinion between fellow economists which have for the time being almost destroyed the practical influence of economic theory, and will, until they are resolved, continue to do so.


The writer of a book such as this, treading along unfamiliar paths, is extremely dependent on criticism and conversation if he is to avoid an undue proportion of mistakes. It is astonishing what foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too long alone, particularly in economics (along with the other moral sciences), where it is often impossible to bring one’s ideas to a conclusive test either formal or experimental. In this book, even more perhaps than in writing my Treatise on Money, I have depended on the constant advice and constructive criticism of Mr. R. F. Kahn. There is a great deal in this book which would not have taken the shape it has except at his suggestion. I have also had much help from Mrs. Joan Robinson, Mr. R. G. Hawtrey and Mr. R. F. Harrod, who have read the whole of the proof-sheets. The index has been compiled by Mr. D. M. Bensusan-Butt of King’s College, Cambridge.


About the Author

John Maynard Keynes, 1883-1946


John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes, CB (pronounced /'ke?nz/; 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946) was a British economist whose ideas have profoundly affected the theory and practice of modern macroeconomics, as well as the economic policies of governments. He greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and advocated the use of fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, as well as its various offshoots.


In the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking."

Every element of the body (such as the overhang of the upper lip; the puckering at the corners of the mouth; the characteristic proportions of the head, trunk, limbs, etc.; the tension between connected portions of the body; etc.) is carefully and concisely pointed out in the text. Even more helpful are the 430 pencil and charcoal drawings that illustrate each feature so that you are, in effect, shown what to look for by a master teacher. 
The result is the only art instruction book which not only illustrates details of the body but directs your attention at every stage to a host of subtle points of shading, curvature, proportion, foreshortening, muscular tension, variations due to extreme age or youth, and both major and minor differences in the structure and representation of the male and female figure. Comprehensive discussions and drawings cover the eyes; nose, mouth and chin; ear; head, trunk, back and hips; neck, throat, and shoulder; shoulder and arm; hand and wrist; leg; foot; the complete figure; and other interdependent groups of structures. This is the human figure as the artist, art student, and art teacher must know it in order to avoid many deceptive errors unfortunately common in much modern portraiture, painting, and illustrative art."

In a career spanning more than thirty years, David Letterman redefined the modern talk show with an ironic comic style that transcended traditional television. While he remains one of the most famous stars in America, he is a remote, even reclusive, figure whose career is widely misunderstood. In Letterman, Jason Zinoman, the first comedy critic in the history of the New York Times, mixes groundbreaking reporting with unprecedented access and probing critical analysis to explain the unique entertainer’s titanic legacy. Moving from his early days in Indiana to his retirement, Zinoman goes behind the scenes of Letterman’s television career to illuminate the origins of his revolutionary comedy, its overlooked influences, and how his work intersects with and reveals his famously eccentric personality. 

Zinoman argues that Letterman had three great artistic periods, each distinct and part of his evolution. As he examines key broadcasting moments—""Stupid Pet Tricks"" and other captivating segments that defined Late Night with David Letterman—he illuminates Letterman’s relationship to his writers, and in particular, the show’s co-creator, Merrill Markoe, with whom Letterman shared a long professional and personal connection.

To understand popular culture today, it’s necessary to understand David Letterman. With this revealing biography, Zinoman offers a perceptive analysis of the man and the artist whose ironic voice and caustic meta-humor was critical to an entire generation of comedians and viewers—and whose singular style ushered in new tropes that have become clichés in comedy today."

We’ve all had experience with two dramatically different types of leaders. The first type drains intelligence, energy, and capability from the people around them and always needs to be the smartest person in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people’s heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now when leaders are expected to do more with less. 

In this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explores these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizations—getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation. 

In analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman has identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone can learn to use—even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager. This revered classic has been updated with new examples of Multipliers, as well as two new chapters one on accidental Diminishers, and one on how to deal with Diminishers.

Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness all the energy and intelligence around you. Multipliers will show you how."

Enthusiasm for sport is a must, but there is much more to mastering Betfair.

Many people start by just using Betfair to obtain better odds than those available at the traditional bookmakers. They then perhaps do a little more research and learn to trade the markets. But to make a regular profit - to win and keep on winning - a serious, disciplined approach and careful planning need to be employed.

Mastering Betfair takes the reader through many low-risk strategies developed by the author over the past three years, showing how you too can benefit from these approaches to the betting exchanges. It also explains in detail why and how the Betfair user should employ disciplines - such as managing risk - that are normally associated with trading the financial markets. Indeed, through doing this it is hoped that the book will draw the attention of financial traders to the unique opportunities available on Betfair.

This book is essential reading for anyone looking to take their Betfair trading to another level and start making some serious money."

Powerful writing is the key … You might be the most qualified candidate, but if the competition is better at telling a story … you lose. So does the employer, who unwittingly hires that less qualified individual.

Here's what others say …

I attended Colonel Bass' webinar, ""Nail Your Resume! ... Write to Influence!"" Great stuff!! Aspects I never considered:

1) The strategy of ""Setting the Hook""

2) Responding to the employer's quintessential question, ""What's in it for me? What do I gain by hiring you?""

3) Words that convey subliminal messages - great tip - who would have ""thunk it""

4) Finally, ""triaging your data, again and again and again."" More of a ""rinse and repeat"" step, but oh, so important!

I thought my resume was great the first time, boy was I wrong! … Bob Hyatt

A bestselling author and business guru tells how to improve job satisfaction and performance. 

In his sixth fable, bestselling author Patrick Lencioni takes on a topic that almost everyone can relate to: job misery. Millions of workers, even those who have carefully chosen careers based on true passions and interests, dread going to work, suffering each day as they trudge to jobs that make them cynical, weary, and frustrated. It is a simple fact of business life that any job, from investment banker to dishwasher, can become miserable. Through the story of a CEO turned pizzeria manager, Lencioni reveals the three elements that make work miserable -- irrelevance, immeasurability, and anonymity -- and gives managers and their employees the keys to make any job more engaging.

As with all of Lencioni’s books, this one is filled with actionable advice you can put into effect immediately. In addition to the fable, the book includes a detailed model examining the three root causes of job misery and how they can be remedied. It covers the benefits of managing for job engagement within organizations -- increased productivity, greater retention, and competitive advantage -- and offers examples of how managers can use the applications in the book to deal with specific jobs and situations.

Patrick Lencioni is President of The Table Group, a management consulting firm specializing in executive team development and organizational health. As a consultant and keynote speaker, he has worked with thousands of senior executives and executive teams in organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies to high-tech startups to universities and nonprofits. His clients include. AT&T, Direct TV, JCPenney, Microsoft, Nestle, Northwestern Mutual, Southwest Airlines and St. Jude Chilren’s Research Hospital.  Lencioni is the author of ten bestselling books, including The Five Dysfunctions of a Team and The Advantage. He previously worked for Oracle, Sybase, and the management consulting firm Bain & Company."

Job search can be an exciting time or it can be extremely frustrating. No doubt it's both of these during the course of a search that can be expected to take several months or longer.

If you're recently unemployed, we can empathize with your position. We've both been there, done that, and expect to encounter it again in our careers.
If you're about to conclude your college education, you're very much focused on finding that first job, which includes weaving your college work and part-time employment into a cohesive package to present to prospective employers.

This book is about the essentials of that job search. It is a perfect guide to developing all the elements of your search and making just the right impression with your resume and LinkedIn profile, your cover letter, and during the interview.

Jim Wilson is a freelance writer, communicator, and blogger with extensive experience in publishing and communications.

In 2015, my daughter, Brooke Wilson, began work as a university career information specialist, working with students daily on their resumes, conducting monthly resume workshops, coaching students and alumni, as well as working with employers in job fairs and other events. As a result, she has become an expert on the job search process, particularly around resumes and LinkedIn.

Given that background, we've combined our efforts and insight to develop this edition of Job Search Essentials, now version 3.0, which is focused exclusively on helping you build the tools you'll need in the search for your next career adventure.

Yorkshire Post (03/09/13)

Dear Friend,

A friend of mine runs his own law firm in Manchester. I got to know him from the Latino club where he goes to dance Salsa.

When I first got to know him, he was working for another law firm. About a year after we met, he decided to open his own law firm.

When he established his firm, I noticed he went to the club once a quarter.

He did not even smile any longer.

He had completely lost his vibrancy.

Every time he enters the club obviously dragged there by his girlfriend, he looks like a man facing his moment of truth.

When I asked him the reason for his infrequency, he responded that he was constantly busy.

He explained that with all of the new legal regulations; the new insurance regulations and the introduction of the Alternative Business Structures (ABS), it is becoming increasingly difficult for law firms to generate incom and make profit.

When he informed me that he was contemplating opening his own firm. I advised him to take some business and marketing training.

There are two reasons I gave him this advice:

Firstly, I run a security firm. We provide security services to lots of office buildings around Manchester. Many of those buildings host law firms. I have noticed many of those firms constantly downsizing.

Secondly, when I started law firm marketing and consulting, I discover that most law firms are struggling because their owners and partners lack the ability to make the distinction between the profession and the business of law.

There is a difference!

The profession of law is the deliverables: defending the client, writing contract and briefs or representing the interest of the client.

The business of law is about three things:

- Operations: the deliverables
- Marketing: attracting and retaining clients
- Finance: knowing your numbers

Most lawyers are trained in the profession of law, therefore, even when they establish their own law firms, they tend to ignore the other aspects of running a legal business.

This was why I advised my friend to take some business training.

Attending law school does not automatically qualify you to run a legal business.

Just recognising this simple fact will save lots of entrepreneur lawyers the agony of working for less than the MINIMUM WAGE.

There are known and reliable principles for law firm business growth that when deployed properly in a practical way, can attract truckload of potential clients to your firm.

Those principles are the focus of: How To Effectively Market and Manage A Law Firm

Your will learn:

The Law Firm Business Growth Process

The three step law firm business growth process:

- Generating new client
- Increasing the volume per transaction
- Increasing the frequency with which those clients hire you

The Client Attraction Process

The three step effective client attraction process:

- Crafting an effective marketing message
- Identifying the right target market

- Selecting the right media through which to channel your marketing message

What You Must Know About Your Law Firm Marketing

The ultimate key to law firm marketing:

- Psychology
- Mathematics

The skill that brought you out of Egypt cannot take you to the Promise Land.

You cannot succeed as an entrepreneur lawyer with the skillset of an employee.

Learn the requisite skills and the process of growing your law firm from in: How To Effectively Market And Manage A Law Firm.

“At the height of the Global Financial Crisis, the American banking system was too big to fail. Today, the Australian banking system is too big to save.” 


After almost 10 years living abroad, former strategy consultant and GreenRigCo co-founder Lindsay David returns to his native Australia. His years of macroeconomic research suggests that Australia is in the midst of one of the biggest credit and property bubbles in modern Western history—bubbles that are supported by the largest credit bubble in human history, the one that has been brewing in China. 


Australia: Boom to Bust dives deeply into the plausible collapse of the “Three Pillars” of the Australian economy: Banks, Natural Resources and Real Estate. Lindsay David provides unique commentary on the true state of the Australian economy and identifies major defects in the structures of the Three Pillars. Toxic levels of private sector debt sponsored by Australia's largest banks has managed to flood already-inflated asset classes of the Pillars on the back of a once-in-a-lifetime construction boom and property bubble in China. Compelling data and research suggests that the Australian economy has lost touch with reality and has gambled away its banking system to propel the mining and property markets into unchartered waters. 


Powerful Australian property and banking pundits have successfully led Australians to believe that the unusually high cost of real estate is justified. The pundits tell us that Australia is simply “different.” Pundits love to use the word “boom,” but they rarely use the word “bust.” When a country as a whole and its cities lack density alongside a median house price that is more than six times the median household income, there is only one word that can describe the true state of the Australian property sector—bubble. The domestic banking sector in Australia learned absolutely nothing from past economic downturns in Japan, America, Spain and Ireland. Unfortunately, it will suffer the same sad fate that its northern-hemisphere peers did, as history has a good track record of repeating itself. The warnings signs of a toxic Australian credit bubble could not be any clearer—they have simply been ignored."

It has since become the #1 Personal Finance book of all time... translated into dozens of languages and sold around the world.


Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.


20 Years... 20/20 Hindsight

In the 20th Anniversary Edition of this classic, Robert offers an update on what we’ve seen over the past 20 years related to money, investing, and the global economy. Sidebars throughout the book will take readers “fast forward” — from 1997 to today — as Robert assesses how the principles taught by his rich dad have stood the test of time.

In many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were criticized and challenged two decades ago, are more meaningful, relevant and important today than they were 20 years ago.

As always, readers can expect that Robert will be candid, insightful... and continue to rock more than a few boats in his retrospective.

Under such pressure to stay alive—let alone grow—it’s easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in a never-ending cycle of “sell it—do it, sell it—do it” that leaves them exhausted, frustrated, and unable to get ahead no matter how hard they try. 
This is the exact situation Mike Michalowicz found himself in when he was trying to grow his first company. Although it was making steady money, there was never very much left over and he was chasing customers left and right, putting in twenty-eight-hour days, eight days a week. The punishing grind never let up. His company was alive but stunted, and he was barely breathing. That’s when he discovered an unlikely source of inspiration—pumpkin farmers. 

After reading an article about a local farmer who had dedicated his life to growing giant pump­kins, Michalowicz realized the same process could apply to growing a business. He tested the Pumpkin Plan on his own company and transformed it into a remarkable, multimillion-dollar industry leader. First he did it for himself. Then for others. And now you. So what is the Pumpkin Plan?
Plant the right seeds: Don’t      waste time doing a bunch of different things just to please your      customers. Instead, identify the thing you do better than anyone else and      focus all of your attention, money, and time on figuring out how to grow      your company doing it.    Weed out the losers: In      a pumpkin patch small, rotten pumpkins stunt the growth of the robust,      healthy ones. The same is true of customers. Figure out which customers      add the most value and provide the best opportunities for sustained      growth. Then ditch the worst of the worst.    Nurture the winners: Once      you figure out who your best customers are, blow their minds with care.      Discover their unfulfilled needs, innovate to make their wishes come true,      and overdeliver on every single promise.
Full of stories of other successful entrepreneurs, The Pumpkin Plan guides you through unconven­tional strategies to help you build a truly profitable blue-ribbon company that is the best in its field."

Scott Kelby, author of the top-selling digital photography book of all time, is back with an entirely new book in his popular series that picks up right where part 4 left off. It’s more of that “Ah ha—so that’s how they do it,” straight-to-the-point, skip-the-technojargon stuff you can really use today that made part 1 so successful.

In parts 1 through 4 of this series, the most popular chapter in the book has always been the last chapter: “Photo Recipes to Help You Get ‘The Shot’.” In each of those chapters, Scott shows a final image and then describes how to get that type of shot.

Here, in part 5, he gives you what you’ve been waiting for: an entire book of nothing but those amazing photo recipes. But, he took it up a big notch by adding a behind-the-scenes photo for every single recipe. Now you can see exactly how it was done, so you can get that exact same look every time.

In these extra pages, each spread allows you to dig in a little deeper and really unlock the power of these recipes. Scott breaks each spread into four segments: (1) he explains exactly what you’re seeing behind the scenes, (2) he lists all of his camera settings, and lens and lighting info—it’s all there, (3) he gives you his thought process, so you learn exactly why he does it this way, and (4) he shares all the post-processing in Lightroom or Photoshop that goes on after the shoot (this is something other books leave out). Plus, the whole book is packed with tips and insights you won’t find anywhere else.

This isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which settings to use, and exactly how and when to use them. With around 100 of the most popular photographic “tricks of the trade,” the entire book is designed to get you shooting like a pro starting today. You’re gonna love it."

The authors get at the heart of what makes a leader successful in this classic business fable. Newly promoted but struggling young executive Debbie Brewster asks her mentor, “What is the secret of great leaders?” His reply—“great leaders serve”—flummoxes her, but over time he reveals the five fundamental ways that leaders succeed through service. Along the way, Debbie learns:
 
•            Why great leaders seem preoccupied with the future
•            How people on the team ultimately determine your success or failure
•            What three arenas require continuous improvement
•            Why true success in leadership has two essential components
•            How to knowingly strengthen—or unwittingly destroy—leadership credibility
 
This new edition includes a leadership self-assessment so readers can measure to what extent they lead by serving and where they can improve. The authors have also added answers to the most frequently asked questions about how to apply the SERVE model in the real world. As practical as it is uplifting, The Secret shares Blanchard and Miller's wisdom about leadership in a form that anyone can easily understand and implement."

How about the one that says it’s selling out if an artist strategizes to profit off of their work? Or that a true artist works alone? In Real Artists Don’t Starve, author and creativity expert Jeff Goins has set out to replace these false narratives and replace them with timeless strategies for thriving as a creative and debunking the myth of the starving artist.From graphic designers and writers to artists and business professionals, creatives already know that no one is born an artist. Instead, those who have entered a creative field have already utilized the imagination in fundamental ways in order to accomplish what they have thus far. And contrary to popular myth, Goins believes their artistic temperament has actually given them a competitive advantage in the marketplace.Through inspiring anecdotes of successful creatives both past and present, Goins explores the tension every creative person and organization faces in an effort to blend the inspired life with a practical path to success. Being creative isn’t a disadvantage for success; rather, it is a powerful tool to be harnessed."

Rifkin uncovers a paradox at the heart of capitalism that has propelled it to greatness but is now taking it to its death—the inherent entrepreneurial dynamism of competitive markets that drives productivity up and marginal costs down, enabling businesses to reduce the price of their goods and services in order to win over consumers and market share. (Marginal cost is the cost of producing additional units of a good or service, if fixed costs are not counted.) While economists have always welcomed a reduction in marginal cost, they never anticipated the possibility of a technological revolution that might bring marginal costs to near zero, making goods and services priceless, nearly free, and abundant, and no longer subject to market forces.

Now, a formidable new technology infrastructure—the Internet of things (IoT)—is emerging with the potential of pushing large segments of economic life to near zero marginal cost in the years ahead. Rifkin describes how the Communication Internet is converging with a nascent Energy Internet and Logistics Internet to create a new technology platform that connects everything and everyone. Billions of sensors are being attached to natural resources, production lines, the electricity grid, logistics networks, recycling flows, and implanted in homes, offices, stores, vehicles, and even human beings, feeding Big Data into an IoT global neural network. Prosumers can connect to the network and use Big Data, analytics, and algorithms to accelerate efficiency, dramatically increase productivity, and lower the marginal cost of producing and sharing a wide range of products and services to near zero, just like they now do with information goods. 

The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy—part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons—with far reaching implications for society, according to Rifkin. Hundreds of millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to the global Collaborative Commons. Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling IoT and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost. They are also sharing cars, homes, clothes and other items via social media sites, rentals, redistribution clubs, and cooperatives at low or near zero marginal cost. Students are enrolling in free massive open online courses (MOOCs) that operate at near zero marginal cost. Social entrepreneurs are even bypassing the banking establishment and using crowdfunding to finance startup businesses as well as creating alternative currencies in the fledgling sharing economy. In this new world, social capital is as important as financial capital, access trumps ownership, sustainability supersedes consumerism, cooperation ousts competition, and ""exchange value"" in the capitalist marketplace is increasingly replaced by ""sharable value"" on the Collaborative Commons. 

Rifkin concludes that capitalism will remain with us, albeit in an increasingly streamlined role, primarily as an aggregator of network services and solutions, allowing it to flourish as a powerful niche player in the coming era. We are, however, says Rifkin, entering a world beyond markets where we are learning how to live together in an increasingly interdependent global Collaborative Commons."

Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.

While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.

With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.

Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.

The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain technology’? The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks."

This is the earliest collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays and was was printed in 1623, just seven years after his death.


For students of King Henry IV Part 1, going back to these First Folio plays is an essential part of a more complete understanding of Shakespeare's work.


Eighteen of Shakespeare’s plays had already been published in the small, cheap format known as quartos during his lifetime, including such favourites as A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet. The First Folio added another eighteen, including Macbeth, The Tempest and Twelfth Night all of which are indispensable to the modern repertory. Without the First Folio only half of Shakespeare’s dramatic output would have survived.


King Henry IV part I is one of Shakespeare's history plays, and is the first of three plays on Henry IV. It draws heavily on inspiration from Holinshed's 'Chronicles', and was written in or before 1597.

A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day.

 Considered  among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl  Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993),  was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding  vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The  Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics  in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively  prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are  so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.

 Economic commentators  across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse  of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication  of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong  — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets,  economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make  Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been  since publication."

That’s why many are calling this non-traditional plan, “America’s Most Powerful Retirement Plan.” Less than .01% have even heard of this patent pending plan. The rich have quietly been using variations of this plan for over a century. Large corporations, banks and financial institutions own hundreds of billions worth of these plans. The reason some of the brightest minds in the world invest so heavily in these strategies is because, they work!

If you’re like the majority of Americans who have been faithfully following the mainstream traditional investment advice, and relying on your IRA (Individual Retirement Account) or 401(k) to reach your retirement goals, you’re probably very concerned about having enough funds to last throughout retirement. 61% of Americans fear running out of money during retirement, more than they fear death. It doesn't have to be that way. This plan can help you to look forward to retirement, instead of dreading it.

We’re giving away our custom retirement savings calculator for free. In our opinion, it’s the best retirement calculator out there. It visually shows you the power of this plan compared to your current retirement plan, IRA, ROTH, 401(k), etc. You can get your free Barefoot Retirement calculator at: BarefootRetirement.com/calculator

This is not just another boring financial book. It’s written in layman’s terms and you will find lots of images and charts to help you clearly grasp the concepts. This book will show you how you can create a retirement plan that offers:

•100% tax-free retirement income
•Life-time, tax-free, predictable income that lasts as long as you do
•Single most powerful tax strategy that’s legally allowed in this great country
•Completely private and requires no reporting
•Guarantees you will not lose money due to market declines

Learn How to Free Yourself and Your Life Through the Power of Fastlane Entrepreneurship


By all appearances, Jeff and Samantha Trotman are living the American Dream. But behind the white picket fence, they endure an American Nightmare. With little time for each other, a pile of debt, and Ferrari taste on a Ford budget, the ruse of affluence is killing them. Two respectable jobs and a lovely suburban house paint a pretty picture, but behind the ink is a broken marriage rife with meaningless work and dead dreams. And now, with an unplanned pregnancy, they're facing a mid-life crisis twenty years early. 


With little time and looming bankruptcy, the Trotmans are forced to face the red-pill truth they long denied: They were living, but they weren't alive. Determined to resurrect their life and their marriage, the Trotmans plot a rat-race escape-only to find themselves more thickly in it. 


As tensions rise and hope fades, follow along step-by-step as the Trotmans pivot to a new strategy and a new career: starting a business as entrepreneurs. 


While they navigate their journey, you'll learn 120 wealth-building strategies and principles that your mainstream financial guru won't dare reveal-actionable concepts that will help you profit your way into the Unscripted 1%, an emerging economic class of entrepreneurs who enjoy a lifetime of freedom emancipated from miserly living and Wall Street's ""save, pray, and wait"" paradigm. Discover how one family escapes the rat-race grind and wins a lifetime of financial freedom, leaving behind the tyranny of meaningless jobs and mediocre living- and how you can too. 


Here is just a little of what you will learn:


	•	The Bad Math Principle: Why most people will never escape the rat-race, much less earn financial freedom.

	•	The 1/5/10 Strategy: How this one simple exercise will unearth your ultimate dream life while establishing a decision framework for its reality.

	•	The Honeypot Principle: Why the financial media's ""invest a $100/mo for 40 years in indexed-funds"" narrative is part of the same rat-race scheme, just a different side of the same rigged coin.

	•	The Dual Change Strategy: The two divergent sides of change and how it can make you a fortune.

	•	The Value Skew Strategy: How to find literally 1000s of business ideas and why you never need to ""disrupt"" or invent anything new or novel.

	•	The Millionaire Payday Strategy: How to spot opportunities to hire yourself and earn an instant millionaire-making income.

	•	The Cinderella Principle: Why starting a business based on a cultural trend or a fad is a horrible idea.

	•	The Perseverance Strategy: Never struggle with motivation again; the four necessary ingredients to tap into unlimited motivation and determination, regardless of the obstacles in your way.

	•	The Triangulated Value Strategy: Learn how to never quit three-feet from gold: The 3-pronged strategy in maximizing marketing yields while also illuminating the ""quit or continue"" decision.

	•	and over 110+ more!


Don't let the rat-race and its co-conspirators proclaim your life as non-essential. Don't let the rat-race entice you to save your life away for the promise of an elderly retirement. Don't let the rat-race lull you into a tedious existence medicated by television, video games, and trivial sporting events. 


Go Unscripted, escape the rat-race, and win your happily-ever-after."

Will Lisa O'Connor's strength of spirit, reinforced by her love of the Australian outback and the Aboriginal culture, see her prevail against the escalating sinister intentions surrounding her?

It is the early 1970s. Lisa O'Connor is still haunted by her horrific past. The abuse she suffered at the hands of her brother-in-law and while incarcerated at the Parramatta Girls Home is about to come full circle. A police investigation into these crimes is now being carried out by Sydney detectives, throwing Lisa back into turmoil. Will the detectives believe her? Will justice ever catch up with her monstrous abusers? Or will they elude capture and punishment?

While under the care of a prominent psychiatrist, Lisa continues to heal from her ordeal. But a new, more sinister threat emerges. An unbalanced and menacing individual has set his sights on Lisa and will stop at nothing to have her. With her close friend Billy still on walkabout, and with her new life at Woori endangered, will she survive this time? 

Sinister Intent, book two in the Red Dust series, picks up where the bestseller Splintered Heart left off. Set against the backdrop of the majestic Australian outback, and with its rich cast of characters, both old and new, this sequel is a masterful page turner. Packed full of suspense, romance, tragedy and loss, author Linda Dowling brings a young girl's saga alive again."

It exhibits some of the main challenges facing African democracies while they attempt to consolidate the benefits of democratisation.


Political Transition and Inclusive Development in Malawi critically analyses opportunities and constraints related to the impact of democracy on development in one of the world’s poorest countries. The book explores how, and to what extent, processes related to democratic and economic governance can be strengthened in order to make political and administrative authorities more responsive to development needs. It also considers characteristics of successful implementation of public policy and the effective and timely delivery of basic services in local contexts; increased citizen participation and dialogue with local government authorities; factors that enable civil society organisations to hold political and administrative officials to account; and better utilisation of academic research for improved evidence-based policy formulation and implementation.

This volume will be of great interest to scholars in development studies, African studies, politics, law and anthropology, as well as policymakers and those interested in democracy, governance, human rights and the implementation of anti-poverty programmes, development administration and decentralisation."

 In the decades following the Civil War, America entered an era of unprecedented corporate expansion, with ultimate financial power in the hands of a few wealthy industrialists who exploited the system for everything it was worth. The Rockefellers, Fords, Morgans, and Vanderbilts were the “lords of creation” who, along with like-minded magnates, controlled the economic destiny of the country, unrestrained by regulations or moral imperatives. Through a combination of foresight, ingenuity, ruthlessness, and greed, America’s giants of industry remolded the US economy in their own image. They established their power and authority, ensuring that they—and they alone—would control the means of production, transportation, energy, and commerce—creating the conditions for the stock market collapse of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed.

 As modern society continues to be affected by wealth inequality and cycles of boom and bust, it’s as important as ever to understand the origins of financial disaster, and the policies, practices, and people who bring them on. The Lords of Creation, first published when the catastrophe of the 1930s was still painfully fresh, is a fascinating story of bankers, railroad tycoons, steel magnates, speculators, scoundrels, and robber barons. It is a tale of innovation and shocking exploitation—and a sobering reminder that history can indeed repeat itself."

Findings of Iron Age in Philippines give testimony to the existence of trade between Tamil Nadu and the Philippine Islands during the ninth and tenth centuries B.C.
During 10th to 14th century A.D. trade relations between India and Philippines flourished and there were Indian influences on culture and languages of Philippines.
During the 18th century, there was robust trade between Manila and the Coromandel Coast of India, involving Philippine exports of tobacco, silk, cotton, indigo, sugar cane and coffee.
Since the Spanish period India-Philippines trade declined. After independence the two countries established diplomatic relation, and a friendship treaty was signed on 11 July 1952. But because of differences in foreign policy economic relation between the two countries was restored only during 1970s after Aditya Birla, an Indian industrialist took initiative in establishing Indo-Phil, a joint India-Philippines venture in textiles. There after various steps were taken to restore trade relation between the two countries. Some of the steps are:
A trade agreement signed between the Philippines and India was signed on 29 May 1979.
In 1995, a Joint Working Group and a Joint Business Council were set up to assess and identify potentials for trade as well as identify new areas for collaboration.
The Philippines – India Business Council (PIBC) was organized in 1997.
The Policy Consultation Talks between the two countries were established in 2000.
On May 8, 2002 under the umbrella organization of Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), PIBC was convened with the objective of restoring and enhancing business ties and friendly relations with the Indian business community
From November 9-16, 2003, a delegation from PIBC traveled the three major cities of Mumbai, Hyderabad and New Delhi in India.
The Joint Commission on Bilateral Co-operation, to further strengthen and develop the co-operation in the field of trade, economic, scientific, technological and other fields of co-operation was signed during the State Visit to India of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on 5 October 2007.
The inaugural session of the Joint Commission was held on 15 March 2011.
An exhibition was organized by the Synthetic and Rayon Textiles Export Promotion Council of Philippines and rayon textile producers and exporters from India in June 2012 in Manila. Trade between the two countries was increased by 10.8% during 2011-12.
It is expected that with further efforts on the part of the two countries trade between the two countries would rise rapidly benefiting both the economies."

Are they masters of an occult knowledge, lucky winners in a random market lottery, natural-born virtuosi—Mozarts of the markets? In search of an answer, bestselling author Jack D. Schwager interviewed dozens of top traders across most financial markets. While their responses differed in the details, all of them could be boiled down to the same essential formula: solid methodology + proper mental attitude = trading success. In Market Wizards Schwager lets you hear, in their own words, what those super-traders had to say about their unprecedented successes, and he distils their responses down into a set of guiding principles you can use to become a trading star in your own right. 
 Features interviews with superstar money-makers including Bruce Kovner, Richard Dennis, Paul Tudor Jones, Michel Steinhardt, Ed Seykota, Marty Schwartz, Tom Baldwin, and more Tells the true stories behind sensational trading coups, including the one about the trader who turned $30,000 into $80 million, the hedge fund manager who's averaged 30% returns every year for the past twenty-one years, and the T-bond futures trader who parlayed $25,000 into $2 billion in a single day!  
""Market Wizards is one of the most fascinating books ever written about Wall Street. A few of the 'Wizards' are my friends—and Jack Schwager has nailed their modus operandi on the head.""

The more Hamlet broods and schemes, a shadow over Elsinore is growing ever darker, until a case of mistaken identity leaves an innocent bystander murdered.

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?

The shocking answer is: None of the above!

In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: ""Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!"" Eker does this by identifying your ""money and success blueprint."" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.

Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and ""revise"" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.

In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen ""Wealth Files,"" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.

If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!"

Firstly, profit equals ‘on paper revenue’ minus ‘on paper expenses’, and not necessarily money in the bank. Cash flow equals the actual money flowing into and out of your business at any given time and is affected by the timing of liability payments, loan repayments, Directors’ drawings, the time it takes your debtors to actually pay, and so on. The problem is, cash flow lags behind profit for most businesses."

Or that a boy born in January is nearly twice as likely to play first grade rugby league as a boy born in December? Or that natural disasters attract more foreign aid if they happen on a slow news day? And that a perfectly clean desk can be as inefficient as a messy one?


Drawing on examples and data from across Australia, Andrew Leigh shows how economics can be used to illuminate what happens on the sporting field, in the stockmarket, and at work. Economics has things to say about AC/DC and Arthur Boyd, dating and dieting, Grange and Geelong, murder and poverty. Incentives matter, often in surprising ways, and seemingly simple everyday activities can have unexpected outcomes. Insights from behavioural economics can also help us make better decisions.


If you like fresh facts and provocative ideas, this is great train and weekend reading. You'll soon see the world and the people around you in a new light.

His instructions were simple. There was only one rule. They could only invest in their ten best ideas to make money.


It seemed like a foolproof plan to make a lot of money. What could possibly go wrong? These were some of the greatest minds at work in the markets today - from top European hedge fund managers to Wall Street legends.


But most of the investors' great ideas actually lost money. Shockingly, a toss of a coin would have been a better method of choosing whether or not to invest in a stock.


Nevertheless, despite being wrong most of the time, many of these investors still ended up making a lot of money.


How could they be wrong most of the time and still be profitable? The answer lay in their hidden habits of execution, which until now have only been guessed at from the outside world.


This book lays bare those secret habits for the first time, explaining them with real-life data, case studies and stories taken from Freeman-Shor's unique position of managing these investors on a day-to-day basis.


A riveting read for investors of every level, this book shows you exactly what to do and what not to do when your big idea is losing or winning - and demonstrates conclusively why the most important thing about investing is always the art of execution."

There’s the paralyzing prospect of entering a room full of strangers. The awkward introductions and stilted small talk. The concern that “networking” means you have to exploit others for personal gain – or might appear that way. It’s no wonder so many talented professionals eschew networking altogether. Unfortunately, that means they’re limiting their chances of making the kind of great personal and professional connections that can expand their worldview, enrich their lives, and – yes – even lead to new business opportunities. 
  
 That’s why it’s time to reclaim networking. It doesn’t have to be the province of users and takers; instead, as Forbes and Harvard Business Review contributor Dorie Clark makes clear in this short and actionable guide, networking done right is nothing like the stereotype. It’s not about making shallow, insincere connections and filling your wallet with business cards. Instead, the real goal is to turn brief encounters into mutually-beneficial and lasting friendships—in both your personal and professional life. 
  
 Drawing on wisdom from her own experience and from experts like psychologist Robert Cialdini, marketer Michael Katz, and authors Judy Robinett and Keith Ferrazzi, Clark provides valuable insight on how to be a good networker, including concrete tips on how to:
  
 -          Turn initial small talk into meaningful exchanges
 -          Unlock the power of social media as a networking tool
 -          Transform casual online contacts into real-world connections 
 -          Make the most of conferences 
 -          Set a schedule for keeping in regular touch with your network
 -          Repair and strengthen troubled relationships 
 -          Create your own events and become a connector
  
 Whether you’re an introvert or extrovert, and whether you currently relish or loathe making new connections, Clark will teach you the strategies you need to make networking fun, joyful, and enriching."

     Mein Kampf is an autobiographical manifesto by National Socialist leader Adolf Hitler, in which he outlines his political ideology and future plans for Germany. Volume 1 of Mein Kampf was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926. The book was edited by Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.
     Hitler began dictating the book to Hess while imprisoned for what he considered to be ""political crimes"" following his failed Putsch in Munich in November 1923. Although Hitler received many visitors initially, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book. As he continued, Hitler realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925.
     In Mein Kampf, Hitler used the main thesis of ""the Jewish peril"", which posits a Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership. The narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly antisemitic and militaristic, especially during his years in Vienna. He speaks of not having met a Jew until he arrived in Vienna, and that at first his attitude was liberal and tolerant. When he first encountered the anti-semitic press, he says, he dismissed it as unworthy of serious consideration. Later he accepted the same anti-semitic views, which became crucial in his program of national reconstruction of Germany.

     Mein Kampf has also been studied as a work on political theory. For example, Hitler announces his hatred of what he believed to be the world's two evils: Communism and Judaism. The new territory that Germany needed to obtain would properly nurture the ""historic destiny"" of the German people; this goal, which Hitler referred to as Lebensraum (living space), explains why Hitler aggressively expanded Germany eastward, specifically the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland, before he launched his attack against Russia. In Mein Kampf Hitler openly states that the future of Germany ""has to lie in the acquisition of land in the East at the expense of Russia.""
     During his work, Hitler blamed Germany's chief woes on the parliament of the Weimar Republic, the Jews, and Social Democrats, as well as Marxists, though he believed that Marxists, Social Democrats, and the parliament were all working for Jewish interests. He announced that he wanted to completely destroy the parliamentary system, believing it to be corrupt in principle, as those who reach power are inherent opportunists."

This book explores, analyses, celebrates the world of ""Mad Men"" in all its aspects, and includes an interview with it's Executive Producer and an episode guide. Every few years a new television program comes along to capture and express the zeitgeist. ""Mad Men"" is now that show. Since premiering in July 2007, it's won many awards and is syndicated across the globe. Its imprint is evident throughout contemporary culture, from features to fashions and online debate. Its creator Matthew Weiner, a former exec producer on ""The Sopranos"", has created again compelling, complex characters, this time in the sophisticated go-go world of Madison Avenue through the 1960s, with the excessive drinking and smoking, as well as the playing out of the prejudices and anxieties of an era long neglected in popular culture.

""Mad Men"" is a zeitgeist show of the early twenty-first century, this book demonstrates, partly because its characters are an earlier, confused and conflicted version of ourselves, trying to make the best of a future unfolding at breakneck speed."

To illustrate this, Warrillow introduces us to a fictional small business owner named Alex who is struggling to sell his advertising agency. Alex turns to Ted, an entrepreneur and old family friend, who encourages Alex to pursue three criteria to make his business sellable:   * Teachable: focus on products and services that you can teach employees to deliver.  * Valuable: avoid price wars by specialising in doing one thing better than anyone else.  * Repeatable: generate recurring revenue by engineering products that customers have to repurchase often."

They are attempting to project their distinctiveness and their individuality. Others prefer to wear what is comfortable thinking that this is appropriate since they’ve noticed others in the office also dress this way. And then there are those who want to be known for their style and creativity. They want to stand out from the crowd.

All these women, instead of sending the right message they are signaling to those above that they are not a team player, that they are not ready for promotion.

The mistake is that they don’t view the clothes they wear to work as their corporate uniform.

Don’t lose the point that the real purpose of “the uniform” isn’t for erasing your identity; its purpose reflects the symbolism that “you’re part of the team.” It creates a visual representation of a common goal and a shared purpose.

In the corporate world, the business suit is still viewed as the uniform. This means that, when its leaders are representing the firm, others are not distracted by what they wear but rather the intent is to keep them focused on the message.

Different organizations have different uniforms. Your company may not have the same executive uniform as your best friend’s organization. One company’s formal is another company’s casual. To fit in, you need to look at the star players, those people who have power and influence. See what they are wearing and emulate their dress.

But you might think, “But it’s only clothing! Clothes don’t mean as much as performance.” Can bare legs, snazzy tops or jeans and sneakers really derail a corporate career?

The answer is yes."

The task of explaining the causes of the wealth of the people is going to be too long and complex for a single e-book. To facilitate the explanation and the delivery of the material, an e-book will be published in each logic set of topics. The following are the planned titles of the book series:

Your Wealth
The first book looks at the time savings gained by a single person increasing his physical and mind assets in a desert island.

The Wealth of Your Neighbor
The second book is about the agreements that two people have to make to be in a path of increasing their respective wealth.

The Wealth of the Market
The third book explains the possibilities offered by a free market to produce wealth for its people. This book explains the wealth production results when the competitive advantage of every single individual is brought to a free market.

The Wealth of the Business Enterprise
The fourth book is about the function of the business enterprise to produce wealth for the people that are its customers.

The Wealth of the State
The fifth book discusses what happens when we remove the assumption that everybody is going to behave correctly. The book explores the historical formation of the state and the implications for the production of wealth.

The Wealth of Social Capital
The sixth book is the core of the series. Social Capital is defined in this book as the ability of a society to learn and agree on the rules that are necessary for the production of wealth. This is the key for the wealth of the people in society. This is the ingredient that is a prerequisite for physical and human capital formation and is the ingredient missing in many countries that are not able to achieve wealth.

The Wealth of Physical Capital
The seventh book is about the wealth of the physical capital that humanity has today. It should make you grateful that you live in this age and not five hundred or five thousand years ago.

The Wealth of Human Capital
The eighth book is about the wealth of the human capital that humanity has today. A great deal of the human capital is taken for granted. This is a review of what we have today.

The Wealth of a Nation
The ninth book takes us to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. A nation is an entity that comprises a geographical area with a legal setting. It is governed by a state that is the keeper of the social contract. The state maintains the rules of a nation’s Social Capital and thus determines the capital structure of the nation and its citizens.

The Wealth of the Planet Earth
The tenth book is about our planet. It introduces the concept of Natural Capital. What we think of natural resources is actually the capitalization of life that has been happening for millions of years. Unfortunately, many of the actions that we do in the pursuit of wealth production reduce the planet’s natural capital. If the planet was treated as a capital asset, it would be maintained and it would not be consumed risking a drop of the whole world to a lower income level.

The Wealth of the Human Spirit
The eleventh book will be an inquiry about what of all these economic principles might mean in the spiritual world."

Throughout history, rich and poor countries alike have been lending, borrowing, crashing—and recovering—their way through an extraordinary range of financial crises. Each time, the experts have chimed, ""this time is different""—claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters. With this breakthrough study, leading economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff definitively prove them wrong. Covering sixty-six countries across five continents, This Time Is Different presents a comprehensive look at the varieties of financial crises, and guides us through eight astonishing centuries of government defaults, banking panics, and inflationary spikes—from medieval currency debasements to today's subprime catastrophe. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, leading economists whose work has been influential in the policy debate concerning the current financial crisis, provocatively argue that financial combustions are universal rites of passage for emerging and established market nations. The authors draw important lessons from history to show us how much—or how little—we have learned.

Using clear, sharp analysis and comprehensive data, Reinhart and Rogoff document that financial fallouts occur in clusters and strike with surprisingly consistent frequency, duration, and ferocity. They examine the patterns of currency crashes, high and hyperinflation, and government defaults on international and domestic debts—as well as the cycles in housing and equity prices, capital flows, unemployment, and government revenues around these crises. While countries do weather their financial storms, Reinhart and Rogoff prove that short memories make it all too easy for crises to recur.

An important book that will affect policy discussions for a long time to come, This Time Is Different exposes centuries of financial missteps."

It’s a compelling tale of high-profile successes and perilous setbacks, of perseverance and family support, high-stakes risks, and a willingness to constantly challenge the status quo.

 

Daniel J. Edelman opened a small public relations firm in Chicago in 1952 with the desire to invent “marketing PR.”  For the next 60 years, Dan and his firm, now 66 offices and 4,500 employees worldwide, would  transform the field of PR, first in the United States, and then throughout the rest of the world.

 

Edelman and the Rise of Public Relations follows the fascinating tale of Dan Edelman and his unprecedented impact on 21st-century public relations, from his creation of the media tour and marketing public relations to his celebrated creative campaigns featuring such legendary figures as Colonel Sanders and Morris the Cat; and from his pioneering efforts in environmental and litigation PR to his quest to spread modern public relations around the world.

 

Iconic. Improbable. Captivating. The book is a candid, behind-the-scenes look at the firm – and the family – that has become synonymous with the practice of modern public relations as we know it.

 

 

About the Author

Franz Wisner is The New York Times best-selling author of Honeymoon with My Brother and How the World Makes Love.  He's also a proud Edelman alumnus, having opened the firm's Sacramento offices in 1994.  Wisner lives with his wife, actress Tracy Middendorf, and their two boys, Calvin and Oscar, in Brooklyn, New York.

Want to get started investing in the stock market, but aren't sure how to do so?

What are stocks?

What determines their market prices?

Why do they go up and down?

How can I beat the stock market?

What are mutual funds?

What are index funds?

What are Exchanged Traded Funds?

Even though the stock market is the heart of a country's wealth, and even though it enables everybody to be a part owner in the largest, most successful countries in the world, it's not taught in public schools.

But be warned: the mainstream press often misrepresents the stock market. They focus on making the news exciting and dramatic to sell copies.

Frankly, the best investing is boring investing. It's putting as much money as you can afford into many companies, and reinvesting dividends. And continuing to do so until you reach retirement age.

The best investing is not about trying to figure out what's going to happen in the economy or the markets tomorrow, next week, next month or next year.

Many financial writers try to make you think you have to work hard at investing. You must study stock charts every night. Read annual reports. Thoroughly analyze a company's financial statements. Read THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, BARRON'S, and MONEY MAGAZINE. Buy special software. Hang out in online investing forums.

Not so!

Don't waste your time. This book takes modern financial theory to its logical conclusion. You can get the maximum long term benefit by following its simple plan. No tedious math or economics theory needed.

It's simple to set up. Then you forget about it. Pay no attention to the financial news. Just focus on making the most money you can in your career or business, that's all.

And if you're starting small, we've got you covered to.

You'll learn the various kinds of stocks and the various ways to invest in them, including tax-deferred retirement accounts such as an IRA.

This work is shorter than Stock Investing for Dummies.

Warning: the investment world is full of people who think your money should belong to them.

All told, this supplement examines nearly 450 stories, including the pre-Doctor Who Magazine comics (1964-1979); the 1960s and 1970s Dalek-related books; the World Distributors Doctor Who annuals; the 1960s Peter Cushing films; the Cadet sweet cigarette card stories; sketches and parodies such as The Curse of Fatal Death, Disney Time, Animal Magic and The Day of the Doctor cinema intros; sales pitches such as the Prime Computer Adverts and the New Zealand Superannuation Adverts; the 1980s and 2000s Choose Your Own Adventure-style books; and more.

He was the preeminent philosopher in what is now called the Scottish Enlightenment, a time that was “crowded with genius” and in a place regarded as the rebirth of the golden era of Athens. His writing displayed an astonishing range, addressing everything from metaphysics to politics, and in subject after subject he produced fresh, novel, and brilliant insights.


Hume was born in 1711 in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father died when Hume was only two years old, and he was raised by his mother, Katherine, an advocate (or lawyer). Hume matriculated at the University of Edinburgh at the tender age of 10, pursuing the then-standard course of study of Greek, Latin, metaphysics, and “natural philosophy” or natural science. Until he was 22, he engaged in independent study, reading widely in history, literature, philosophy, law, and theology. 


Hume wanted to devote himself to reading and writing literature and philosophy. His resources were “very slender,” however, so he traveled to France and resolved to live as frugally as possible so that he could maintain his independence and dedicate his life to “the improvement of my talents in literature.” During his time there, and by this time in his late twenties, he wrote what is now considered one of the great texts in Western philosophy, his Treatise of Human Nature, which was published in two parts in 1739 and in 1740. The Treatise offered an account of human psychology, of causation and the limits of human knowledge, and of the origins and nature of moral judgments. He went on to produce penetrating insights on topics in political economy such as debt, interest, trade, and the origins and limits of political obedience, along with insights on many other areas ranging from aesthetics to religion. This book focuses on a handful of his central contributions with an emphasis on political economy, in particular his conception and defense of commercial society and of the role government should play in protecting it.


To his regret, Hume never married and had no children, and he was twice denied university professorships because of his religious “scepticism.” He included among his friends Adam Smith and many other luminaries of his time, but it was and is through his writings that his brilliance, his insight, his wit, his curiosity, and his joy emanate."

Written far before communism's meaning became mired in political definitions, Marx's clarity of thought and vision presents the idea of an alternative economic system to capitalism, which he argues is exploitative and antithetical to freedom. To this day, 'The Communist Manifesto' remains almost mandatory reading if one has any interest in either history or economics. Now, presented to you in a definitive electronic format.

Buffy is still on screens and on DVD in home television libraries of a wide array of TV watchers and fans. This is also the student text for TV and cultural studies at colleges and universities where Buffy is widely taught. Rhonda Wilcox is a world authority on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", who has been writing and lecturing about the show since its arrival on our screens. This book is the distillation of this remarkable body of work and thought, a celebration of the series that she proposes is an aesthetic test case for television. Buffy is enduring as art, she argues, by exploring its own possibilities for long-term construction as well as producing individual episodes that are powerful in their own right. She examines therefore the larger patterns that extend through many episodes: the hero myth, the imagery of light, naming symbolism, Spike, sex and redemption, Buffy Summers compared and contrasted with Harry Potter. She then moves in to focus on individual episodes, such as the ""Buffy musical Once More, with Feeling"", the largely silent Hush and the dream episode ""Restless"" (T.S.

Eliot comes to television). She also examines Buffy's ways of making meaning - from literary narrative and symbolism to visual imagery and sound. Combining great intelligence and wit, written for the wide Buffy readership, this is the worthy companion to the show that has claimed and kept the minds and hearts of watchers worldwide."

Have you ever wondered why other people seem to succeed, while your life is standing still? The truth of the matter is that you have the same opportunities as other people but just haven’t found out how to use them to your own advantage. Life coaches tell clients that they can achieve anything and having the right leadership skills will help drive your life in the right direction.

There are so many people that live mundane lives. They may be highly qualified. They may even be able to make a reasonable living for themselves, but how many of them really live the dream? With the right skills, you can turn your life around and find the right direction. It’s merely a matter of adjusting your outlook.

In this book, we show you all of the skills that great leaders have that set them apart from the rest. We give you examples of people whose names you will recognize and what you will notice is the enthusiasm that these people show toward others. They are on a mission. They know what that mission is and even when they make mistakes along the way, they are able to use these mistakes to learn.

Instead of putting up with your mundane lifestyle, take a step into the shoes of successful leaders and become one. This book tells you how this can happen and where you need to start. The qualities that we have described in the book are those that set normal people apart from extraordinary people. If you would rather turn the other way and continue doing what you do, then this won’t be the book for you. However, if you are fed up with watching as others reap all of the rewards, then this book can show you the qualities you need and explain them to you in an understandable way, so that you are set on the course of success.

Whether you are looking for a promotion, looking to start a business venture or simply looking for a new avenue in your life, these leadership skills will help you pave the way. Each of the skills is explained in full so that you can relate it to your life and begin to see how all of this works together to make your life better."

Youngme Moon identifies the outliers, the mavericks, the iconoclasts—the players who have thoughtfully rejected orthodoxy in favor of an approach that is more adventurous. Some are even “hostile,” almost daring you to buy what they are selling. 

Using her original research on companies such as IKEA and Google, Moon will inspire you to be counterintuitive and meaningfully different—to rethink your business strategy, to stop conforming and start deviating, to stop emulating and start innovating.

However, these companies all adopted specific approaches and principles that transformed their ordinary brands into industry leaders. In other words, great brands can be built—and Denise Lee Yohn knows exactly how to do it.

The ability to be creative in which the techniques of ""brain-storming"" play such an important part is largely a state of mind. It is a state of mind that we all can cultivate.


As a business manager, I have been especially interested in stimulating ideas for two reasons: to benefit the business itself and to help the people who work in that business. In our organization we have had quite a bit of experience with this subject. And I can say that these techniques not only work on specific problems. They also help to broaden a person's outlook on life to open his whole personality to the ""idea concept"" and to encourage a constant, fresh eagerness about all the problems of daily living.” - John McArthur


Have you tried using proper Brainstorming technique to solve a problem? Chances are, you probably have even if you didn’t realise it. For decades, people have used brainstorming to generate ideas and to come up with creative solutions to problems. However you need to know how to use brainstorming correctly for it to be fully effective. 


From this ebook, learn what is exactly brainstorming, why it’s a powerful tool, and how to get the most out of it for your personal or professional lives."

This is the most helpful manual I've ever used. No serious Nikon user should be without this. I find myself referring back to this book quite often - very easy to find what I need and even easier to understand.

-S.B.


It's clear, concise and gets to the heart of the camera's multiple and often confusing options. Very highly recommended - for experienced user and beginner alike.

-G.S.A.


All I Need - I have been using Nikon dSLR cameras for many years. In all this time I have never come across a publication which complements the rather soulless and complex user manual so well. Your excellent work is all I need to exploit the potential of this amazing dSLR.

Yes, and maybe you should. The proof is in this lighthearted collection of life lessons, ground rules, inspirational thoughts, and stirring reminders found in Rod Serling’s timeless fantasy series. Written by veteran TV critic, Mark Dawidziak, this unauthorized tribute is a celebration of the classic anthology show, but also, on another level, a kind of fifth-dimension self-help book, with each lesson supported by the morality tales told by Serling and his writers.

The notion that “it’s never too late to reinvent yourself” soars through “The Last Flight,’’ in which a World War I flier who goes forward in time and gets the chance to trade cowardice for heroism. A visit from an angel blares out the wisdom of “follow your passion” in “A Passage for Trumpet.” The meaning of “divided we fall” is driven home with dramatic results when neighbors suspect neighbors of being invading aliens in “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street.” The old maxim about never judging a book by its cover is given a tasty twist when an alien tome is translated in “To Serve Man.”"

This Business Plan Blueprint highlights relevant information about your business and presents it in a targeted way that will make your business irresistible to funders.

Raising money is a necessity for many businesses if they want to grow. But in order to invest in your business, funders want to see your business plan. The problem is unless you’ve had lots of experience of writing business plans for real businesses that are looking for funding, you are not going to know what to include and how to present your business in the best light to succeed with the fundraising process. Many businesses don't even get a first meeting.

I have worked as a senior business advisor for hundreds of businesses over 12 years. These businesses were of different sizes and operated in a range of sectors. However, having refined my skills for what lenders and investors want to see in a business plan, I guided these businesses to raise millions in funding. It helps that I’ve worked as a business investor myself where I’ve been deciding which business plans and teams to invest in!

Being Invited To Pitch Off The Back Of Your Business Plan

A business plan is often the first introduction to funders about your business. First impressions make a huge difference. A powerful business plan informs funders about:

- How credible you are as a business owner and if funders want to work with you;
- Whether or not you show the right signs of being able to succeed with your business;
- How much understanding you have about what a funder wants from a business plan;
- The opportunity that exists in your business and if it is worth their while;
- The risks that exist in your business and if your business is too risky to invest it.

These are key funder questions and they will be looking to the business plan for answers. Created properly, your business plan should be able to answer these questions to ensure lenders and investors are onside and want to know more so they can be a part of your business. Get this right and you’ll be invited to pitch meetings.

How?

It's all about building up your business plan in a logical and rational way. Being aware of what funders want to see is critical to success. They don't have time to waste on plans that can't answer the pertinent questions quickly. You only get one chance so you need to make the most of it.

This is exactly the process I have used with businesses to successfully raise funds for them. And it can work for you too.

By adopting my process you are making it easier for lenders and investors to make a decision; the decision to fund your business.

Download the ebook to find out how. As well as the ebook edition, you’ll also get:

- access to my course “The Smart Business Plan Academy” for free;
- a PDF edition of the book (in case your ereader doesn’t handle screenshots well)
- access to Blab interviews, and webinars that explain building powerful business plans in more detail.

Or that all fast-food restaurants use red or yellow in their logos? Or that certain stores are always having a sale?  

You may not be aware of these details, yet they've been influencing you all along.  

Every time you purchase, swipe, or click, marketers are able to more accurately predict your behavior. These days, brands know more about you than you know about yourself. Blindsight is here to change that.  

With eye-opening science, engaging stories, and fascinating real-world examples, neuroscientist Matt Johnson and marketer Prince Ghuman dive deep into the surprising relationship between brains and brands. In Blindsight, they showcase how marketing taps every aspect of our mental lives, covering the neuroscience of pain and pleasure, emotion and logic, fear and safety, attention and addiction, and much more.  

We like to think of ourselves as independent actors in control of our decisions, but the truth is far more complicated. Blindsight will give you the ability to see the unseeable when it comes to marketing, so that you can consume on your own terms. On the surface, you will learn how the brain works and how brands design for it. But peel back a layer, and you'll find a sharper image of your psychology, reflected in your consumer behavior.   

This book will change the way you view not just branding, but yourself, too."

The biggest problem that most entrepreneurs have isn't creating an amazing product or service; it's getting their future customers to discover that they even exist. Every year, tens of thousands of businesses start and fail because the entrepreneurs don't understand this one essential skill: the art and science of getting tra­ffic (or people) to find you.
And that is a tragedy.
Traffic Secrets was written to help you get your message out to the world about your products and services. I strongly believe that entrepreneurs are the only people on earth who can actually change the world. It won't happen in government, and I don't think it will happen in schools.
It'll happen because of entrepreneurs like you, who are crazy enough to build products and services that will actually change the world. It'll happen because we are crazy enough to risk everything to try and make that dream become a reality.
To all the entrepreneurs who fail in their first year of business, what a tragedy it is when the one thing they risked everything for never fully gets to see the light of day.
Waiting for people to come to you is not a strategy.
Understanding exactly WHO your dream customer is, discovering where they're congregating, and throwing out the hooks that will grab their attention to pull them into your funnels (where you can tell them a story and make them an offer) is the strategy. That's the big secret.
Traffic is just people. This book will help you find YOUR people, so you can focus on changing their world with the products and services that you sell."

Building a fulfilling life and career can be a daunting challenge. It takes courage and hard work. Too often, we charge down a path leading to “success” as defined by those around us—and ultimately, are left feeling dissatisfied.

Each of us is unique and brings distinctive skills and qualities to any situation. So why is it that most of us fail to spend sufficient time learning to understand ourselves and creating our own definition of success? The truth is, it can seem so natural and so much easier to just do what everyone else is doing—for now—leaving it for later to develop our best selves and figure out our own unique path. Is there a road map that will enable you to defy conventional wisdom, resist peer pressure, and carve out a path that fits your unique skills and passions?

Robert Steven Kaplan, leadership expert and author of the highly successful book What to Ask the Person in the Mirror, regularly advises executives and students on how to tackle these questions. In this indispensable new book, Kaplan shares a specific and actionable approach to defining your own success and reaching your potential. Drawing on his years of experience, Kaplan proposes an integrated plan for identifying and achieving your goals.

Was it the innate riskiness of derivatives and other complex financial instruments? Or the instability of the housing market and loans? Or maybe it was the aggregate greed of a horde of high-powered executives?


One thing is for sure: something definitely is wrong. Maybe it is how people look at money in the first place. Many believe that paper money is real, that it carries with it actual purchasing power. But in fact it is only legal tender almost a polite phrase for legal fiction and is just an invented symbol that allows the convenient exchange of goods and/or services.


This insistence on going beyond appearances and into the real nature of things is one of the guiding principles espoused in David Cameron Gikandi s A Happy Pocket Full of Money: Your Quantum Leap into the Understanding, Having, and Enjoying of Immense Abundance and Happiness. The subtitle is more than just a figure of speech this book shows how recent discoveries in theoretical physics are actually relevant in the creation of personal wealth.


Using a step-by-step approach and explained in straightforward language, A Happy Pocket Full of Money discusses these fascinating insights and lets readers see how their act of observation can actually affect that which is being observed a profound view with much bearing on those who want to create wealth.


If you want to be on the path towards financial independence and prosperity, then take the first step and have A Happy Pocket Full of Money.


In A Happy Pocket Full of Money, Gikandi explains that true wealth is not about having buckets of cash, but rather understanding the value within. True wealth flows out of developing ""wealth consciousness,"" that incorporates gratitude, a belief in abundance, and an ability to experience joy in life. He explores how recent discoveries in theoretical physics are relevant for the creation of personal wealth and shows readers how to create abundance by saving, giving, offering charity, and building happy relationships.


This inspirational book will change how you view and create money, wealth, and happiness in your life."

Bosses are maddening. Colleagues are profoundly irritating. And balancing family and work is daunting. So how do we balance success with sanity? How do we progress without burning out? 

Whether you're drowning in a toxic working environment, battling burnout, recovering from redundancy, or just struggling to figure out what you actually want from your career, Cate Sevilla is here to help coach you through the shittiness of your work day, and help you shift your relationship with your career.

Drawing from lessons learned in her career and interviews with other women, How to Work Without Losing Your Mind is a relatable and reassuring guide to the messy, stressful and sometimes bizarre side of work that everyone experiences but no one talks about.

It's no secret that we're pushed to the limit. Today's professionals feel rushed, overwhelmed, and perennially behind. So we keep our heads down, focused on the next thing, and the next, without a moment to breathe.

How can we break out of this endless cycle and create the kind of interesting, meaningful lives we all seek?

Just as CEOs who optimize for quarterly profits often fail to make the strategic investments necessary for long-term growth, the same is true in our own personal and professional lives. We need to reorient ourselves to see the big picture so we can tap into the power of small changes that, made today, will have an enormous and disproportionate impact on our future success. We need to start playing The Long Game.

As top business thinker and Duke University professor Dorie Clark explains, we all know intellectually that lasting success takes persistence and effort. And yet so much of the relentless pressure in our culture pushes us toward doing what's easy, what's guaranteed, or what looks glamorous in the moment. In The Long Game, she argues for a different path. It's about doing small things over time to achieve our goals—and being willing to keep at them, even when they seem pointless, boring, or hard.

In The Long Game, Clark shares unique principles and frameworks you can apply to your specific situation, as well as vivid stories from her own career and other professionals' experiences. Everyone is allotted the same twenty-four hours—but with the right strategies, you can leverage those hours in more efficient and powerful ways than you ever imagined. It's never an overnight process, but the long-term payoff is immense: to finally break out of the frenetic day-to-day routine and transform your life and your career."

A mash-up of the best elements of Crush It! and The Thank You Economy with a fresh spin, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook is a blueprint to social media marketing strategies that really works. 

When managers and marketers outline their social media strategies, they plan for the “right hook”—their next sale or campaign that’s going to knock out the competition. Even companies committed to jabbing—patiently engaging with customers to build the relationships crucial to successful social media campaigns—want to land the punch that will take down their opponent or their customer’s resistance in one blow. Right hooks convert traffic to sales and easily show results. Except when they don’t.

Thanks to massive change and proliferation in social media platforms, the winning combination of jabs and right hooks is different now.

Stories with large casts of characters pose specific challenges to writers and require particular skill sets and tools if they are going to contribute to the telling of a story, rather than detract. Alas, most writers have no clue how even to begin writing multiple-character, stories and so they fall back on the only advice ""out there"" in the consensus writing community: just do it, just write, the characters will write themselves. Well, characters never write themselves, and the more of them you have, the more complex story development becomes. This fourth e-book in the ""Rapid Story Development Series"" tackles the problem of multi-character stories, teams, and ensembles and gives you the craft knowledge and tools you need to master developing stories with large casts successfully."

Contrary to traditional approaches, which emphasize a linear progression from research, through development, to engineering, production, and marketing, Jolly focuses on the benefits of an underlying dual insight, a commitment to scientific rigor and market orientation from the outset.

From this perspective, he develops a framework for achieving successful technology commercialization by identifying the key functions, value outcomes, and stakeholders at each stage of the technology's evolution, and focusing on the resources required to progress from one stage to the next. Drawing on scores of case examples from a wide variety of industries, Jolly highlights both successful and unsuccessful attempts at technology commercialization, and makes the case for a new approach to R&D management based on specialization by stage rather than by function. In so doing, he explores the implications for managing technology investments over short- and long-term time horizons."

Comedians Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld never thought anyone would watch their sitcom about a New York comedian sitting around talking to his friends. But against all odds, viewers did watch—first a few and then many, until nine years later nearly forty million Americans were tuning in weekly. Fussy Jerry, neurotic George, eccentric Kramer, and imperious Elaine—people embraced them with love.

Seinfeldia, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong’s intimate history is full of gossipy details, show trivia, and insights into how famous episodes came to be. Armstrong celebrates the creators and fans of this American television phenomenon, bringing readers into the writers’ room and into a world of devotees for whom it never stopped being relevant. Seinfeld created a strange new reality, one where years after the show had ended the Soup Nazi still spends his days saying “No soup for you!”, Joe Davola gets questioned every day about his sanity, and Kenny Kramer makes his living giving tours of New York sites from the show.

Seinfeldia is an outrageous cultural history. Dwight Garner of The New York Times Book Review wrote: “Armstrong has an eye for detail….Perhaps the highest praise I can give Seinfeldia is that it made me want to buy a loaf of marbled rye and start watching again, from the beginning.”"

Unquestionably the best-documented account of sales success ever collected and the result of the Huthwaite corporation's massive 12-year, $1-million dollar research into effective sales performance, this groundbreaking resource details the revolutionary SPIN (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-payoff) strategy.

Rackham answers key questions such as “What makes success in major sales” and “Why do techniques like closing work in small sales but fail in larger ones?”

The real question of course is: Does Online Advertising work?

Unfortunately, it's impossible to give a simple answer to this apparently straightforward question. For starters, this is not a single question, but three.

The right question to ask would be: for whom does Online Advertising work?

Do Banner Ads, what we once called Interactive Advertising and now call Display Ads because nobody clicks on them, and much less ""interacts"" with them, work for Publishers? Do they work for Advertisers? Or do they just work for the Middlemen based in Silicon Valley?

The 15 Questions:

1. Why Banner Ads?
2. What was Online Advertising supposed to be like?
3. Did it work out as advertised?
4. Why not?
5. Why are Banner Ads still around?
6. Is all this Targeting good?
7. Is this Advertising at all?
8. How big is this thing?
9. What is Programmatic?
10. Does Online Advertising work for Publishers?
11. Does it work for Advertisers?
12. Does it work for the Middlemen?
13. Is it a gigantic scam?
14. Should my company stay away from Banner Ads?

Three towering works of Greek tragedy depicting the inexorable downfall of a doomed royal dynasty

The legends surrounding the house of Thebes inspired Sophocles to create this powerful trilogy about humanity's struggle against fate. King Oedipus is the devastating portrayal of a ruler who brings pestilence to Thebes for crimes he does not realize he has committed and then inflicts a brutal punishment upon himself. Oedipus at Colonus provides a fitting conclusion to the life of the aged and blinded king, while Antigone depicts the fall of the next generation, through the conflict between a young woman ruled by her conscience and a king too confident of his own authority.

Investing and trading is hard. No argument about that.

However, most people make it complicated and in turn, successfully cause the myth that only insiders can make money in the market.

Totally untrue.

Everyone --- who is willing to put the time and efforts --- to learn the correct techniques will be able to be a consistently profitable trader / investor in the market.

Any financial market --- from stocks, bonds, futures, options, commodities, and even Forex.

How so? Aren’t they all different instruments?

They are different, but human nature is always the same. And that is the reason understanding the basic of stock chart analysis is critical for every trader – investor out there.

Why? Because human emotions --- especially greed and fear --- are all mapped out on the stock charts.

This book will allow us to review some of the basic stock chart reading skills and I can guarantee you, they will add values to you.

Now, making money consistently in the market, however, does not solely depend on the skills outlined in any of the Trading Charts Don’t Lie books.

And even if people have finished reading and understanding 7 Secret Steps Of A Sure-Fire Trading System and 10 Enigmatic Trading Price Action, there will still be HUGE chance those people will fail. After all, 85% failure rate (in trading) is huge.

Don’t get me wrong. All those techniques are important.

Yet, without the correct money mindset, a trader or investor will subconsciously block himself from achieving the success he desires so much.

The right attitude towards personal finance includes the disciplines to follow certain trading rules and risk management.

Without that disciplines, there would be practically improbable for someone to see trading as business. And if one wants to make money consistently in the market, then one has to STOP treating trading as a hobby and start looking at his/her trading decisions as business decisions.

After all, making profits is the only reason we are all in this market."

Over the course of the year, we add a variety of topics to our article banks.



Typically this provides us 20 plus areas to consider and then we drop this list down into the dirty dozen. These are the key markets or instruments we trade, plus a couple of additional mainstream interest pieces like Bitcoin, Facebook and so on.



One of the big competitive advantages we have over most traders, is our own in house team of analysts and sales traders so a couple of chats and lunches with the guys, often reveals some absolute gems, in terms of core trading points and views.



This year, the 12 areas we are looking at in Outrageous Predictions 2014 are as follows:


Facebook

The World’s leading social media company has flexed its muscles this year. Breaking the stigma of its listing and languishing share price.


China

The outlook for China and its rampant economic growth has been the source of much controversy amongst market participants, traders, research analysts and just about anyone else out there.


Exchange Traded Funds

ETFs have been a massive growth area for traders and investors who are looking to isolate or invest in particular scenarios and opportunities.


The Australian Banking Sector

2013 has been all about finding yield and as a result, the Aussie Big Four banking stocks have been major beneficiaries of their dividend policy.


US Economy

The world’s largest economy forms the mainstay of any economic forecast and outlook for markets. QE is its $85bn a month habit – how is this working for the US, what is in store for the new year and where will we be looking to bank profits? 


Australian Economy

Our domestic economy has shown several colours in 2013 – from doom and despair to opportunity and profit. There have been a variety of factors behind this and several which will carry into 2014.


Australian and US dollars

The relationship between this pair is critical from a trade and traders’ perspective. With the big variation to date in economic activity and interest rate cycles setting the current framework, it looks increasingly likely that the tide is about to turn.


Apple

There is no question that Apple’s business is changing – it had to. With change always comes risk, and always comes opportunity. 


Crude Oil

We try our best to find alternatives but it is almost impossible to live without it! Oil has been one of the most interesting markets this year. 


BHP Billiton

Iron ore isn’t exciting, its not pretty, its not cutting edge but it is the backbone of what has been propping up the Aussie economy.


Gold

In terms of price, gold really has had a year to forget. As the saying goes, the past is history, the future a mystery and the present is a gift.


Bitcoin

No 2014 outlook would be complete without a look at Bitcoin – doubter or believer, what is the story with this overnight phenomena – marketing hype or commercial success?"

 Emotional Intelligence is fast becoming the skill to master that will unlock your true potential.  

 You’ve probably noticed that it’s not the smartest people that are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life; being clever, talented or skilled is not enough. 

 It’s your ability to manage your feelings, other people and your interactions with them that makes the difference.

 We’re all born with this ability - emotional intelligence is a skill and we all have the capacity to develop this skill. 

 This book will show you how.

 It will change the way you think about emotions. Instead of thinking of emotions as being positive or negative, you will learn that all emotions have a positive intent – all emotions have our best interests in mind.

 Improve your emotional intelligence and you improve your ability to understand and manage emotions. You can think clearly and creatively, manage stress and challenges, communicate well with others and display trust, empathy and confidence. 

 You will be in a better position to handle situations, events and other people that in the past you’ve found difficult or stressful. 

 Emotional Intelligence will show you how to heighten your EQ and improve your personal and work life, including how to

 •    be more assertive and confident
 •    express how you feel, what you want and don’t want. 
 •    understand what others are feeling and forge stronger relationships
 •    manage office politics and navigate the social complexities of the workplace
 •    manage anxiety, anger and disappointment

When it comes to saving and spending money, we're not all the same. Yet for too long, the financial advice world has treated us as if we are. This book will give you the tools you need to make that long-awaited financial breakthrough, allowing you to discover your 'Financial Phenotype': the unique combination comprising your Money Story, your Money Environment, your Money Type and, just as importantly, the habits, triggers and tricks that are right for you.


Once you realise that the one-size-fits-all approach to finances you've been trying to adopt doesn't work for most people, it can be liberating. Finally there's a rational explanation for why you've struggled with money-why you're perpetually sabotaging, why you're constantly at loggerheads with your partner or why you just can't seem to be consistent.


When it comes to other areas of your life, such as food and exercise, you've no doubt embraced a multi-faceted, often highly personalised approach and you recognise that's important. Why should it be any different when it comes to your finances?


That's why understanding your Money Story and discovering your Money Type is the key to financial success."

Conventional accounting uses the logical (albeit, flawed) formula: Sales - Expenses = Profit. The problem is, businesses are run by humans, and humans aren't always logical. Serial entrepreneur Mike Michalowicz has developed a behavioral approach to accounting to flip the formula: Sales - Profit = Expenses. Just as the most effective weight loss strategy is to limit portions by using smaller plates, Michalowicz shows that by taking profit first and apportioning only what remains for expenses, entrepreneurs will transform their businesses from cash-eating monsters to profitable cash cows. Using Michalowicz's Profit First system, readers will learn that:

· Following 4 simple principles can simplify accounting and make it easier to manage a profitable business by looking at bank account balances.
· A small, profitable business can be worth much more than a large business surviving on its top line.
· Businesses that attain early and sustained profitability have a better shot at achieving long-term growth.

With dozens of case studies, practical, step-by-step advice, and his signature sense of humor, Michalowicz has the game-changing roadmap for any entrepreneur to make money they always dreamed of."

Australia’s prosperity and security are linked to China as never before. But what kind of a country is China becoming? Will its demand for Australian goods and services increase? Can the Communist Party continue to keep the middle class satisfied while cracking down on political freedoms? How will China use its economic and military might, especially if challenged by President Trump?



China Matters is a concise overview of China today, and the implications for Australia. Written by Australia-based, internationally renowned China-watchers Bates Gill and Linda Jakobson, it examines the country’s unique dynamism and contradictions. It delves into everything from business ties to the growing influence of the Chinese government in Australia. It is essential reading for anyone wanting to understand China’s complexities and how Australia should respond to secure our future.



‘Cuts through the volatile mix of hype, hysteria and complacency surrounding the Middle Kingdom in Australia to sketch out a nuanced road map for dealing with Asia’s rising super power.’ —Richard McGregor



‘Australians must learn to live with China’s power. This is simply the best all-round guide we have for how to do this.’ —Hugh White



‘For all its modern gloss, China is scarcely less strangely and severely governed by today’s communist elite than it was under imperial dynasties. Yet its connections and influence have already become ubiquitous in Australia today, bringing great opportunity but also risk. This should command the educated attention of all Australians. That is why China matters. That is why China Matters matters.’ —Rowan Callick, author of Party Time: Who Runs China and How



‘For an Australia increasingly divided between a reliance on China for its future prosperity, and an apprehension about what a powerful China means for its security and values, China Matters is a timely intervention. Deeply knowledgeable, engagingly argued, and most importantly wise and balanced, this book should be read by all Australians who think seriously about their country’s future.’ —Michael Wesley, author of Restless Continent: Wealth, Rivalry and Asia’s New Geopolitics"

I’ve been inspired by these images and here attempt my own photographic interpretations of the visual language that is the Tarot. For me this series attempts to deconstruct the symbol systems of the Tarot in an effort to understand the evolution of meaning attached to these images. In a time when it’s far to common to assume each photo we see has been digitally manipulated I strive to capture the scene as seen before my camera. In my studio I create theater and story telling for each theme, captured for others to find their own meaning and symbolic value. For those who believe in the mysteries of the Tarot they contain personality and attempt divination at the heart of each image. Combined they become a secret language and form of expression uniquely their own.



The Tarot Photo Project was started in late 2009 and currently includes forty-eight images. Every photo in the series becomes a portrait that tells the human story within each card. The current goal is to interpret the entire 78 image series and publish the complete tarot deck by the end of 2013."

With features such as a very fast lens with an aperture of f/1.4, excellent image quality, and a solid array of burst-shooting capabilities, the D-Lux 6 has attracted an enthusiastic following. However, the camera does not come with a detailed printed manual for reference, making it hard for users to find answers to questions about the use of the camera’s many controls, menus, and features.



With the release of this guide book to the D-Lux 6, White Knight Press has provided users with a comprehensive guide to all operations of this sophisticated camera. Using a patient, tutorial-like approach, the book provides guidance to beginning and intermediate photographers about how to accomplish things with the D-Lux 6, as well as when and why to use the camera’s many controls, menus options, and other features. The book does not assume specialized knowledge by the reader as it explains topics such as autofocus, manual focus, depth of field, aperture priority, shutter priority, exposure bracketing, white balance, and ISO sensitivity. The book also provides details about the camera’s numerous options for playback, setup, and customizing the operation of the various buttons and other controls.


The book contains approximately 400 photographs, almost all in full color, illustrating the D-Lux 6’s controls, shooting screens, and menus. The images also provide examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the Creative Control settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing and other aspects of images; the Scene shooting mode, with settings that are optimized for various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and action shots; the Photo Style menu option, which provides the ability to customize the appearance of images; and the camera’s strong array of features for continuous shooting and shooting in dim lighting.


In addition, the book goes beyond the bounds of everyday photography, and introduces more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, digiscoping, astrophotography, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography.


The book also includes a full discussion of the video recording abilities of the D-Lux 6, which can shoot high-definition (HD) video with stereo sound, and which offers manual control of exposure and focus during movie recording.


In three appendices, the book provides information about accessories for the D-Lux 6, including cases, external flash units, viewfinders, and filter adapters, and includes a list of web sites and other resources for further information. The book includes a detailed appendix with helpful Quick Tips with insights into how to take advantage of the camera’s features in the most efficient ways possible."

In 2008, my business ran into trouble. Staring at the abyss, just one payment away from bankruptcy, I contacted my accountant.

I remember being sat at his reception, scared and completely despondent as I waited for him to call me in.

I resembled the guys about to face the electric chair in the movies.

When I explained situation, he shook his head as if to say you are toast.

He advised that I closed shop and start afresh.

For me the idea of closing down my business without a fight was something I was unwilling to accept.

I went to my two closest friends for advice…one a professor and the other an entrepreneur.

My professor friend advised that I followed the advice of my accountant, while my entrepreneur friend told me to not even give it a thought.

I still remember my entrepreneur friend telling me: “Romeo accountants are really great with figures, but when it comes to business, they leave a lot to be desired”.

“How many successful accounting firms do you know”?

“You see Romeo, if you want to calculate your expenditures, you can go to your accountant. However, when it comes to management and business growth, you want to be contacting a business consultant”.

He was the one who exposed me to the difference between professionalism and business.

There is a different between the profession of accounting and the business of accounting.

The profession of accounting is the deliverables: creating profit and loss statement, completing end of year account or performing audit on behalf of your client.

The business of accounting on the other hand is about three functions:

- Operations: the deliverables
- Marketing: attracting and retaining clients
- Finance: knowing your numbers

Because most accountants are trained in the profession of accounting, even when they establish their own accounting firms, they tend to ignore the other aspects of running their firms.

Like accounting, business is a profession. Obtaining a CPA does not automatically qualify you to run an accounting business.

Just recognising this simple fact will save lots of entrepreneur accountants the agony of working for less than the minimum wage.

There are known and reliable principles for accounting firm business growth that when deployed properly in a practical way, can attract truckload of potential clients to your firm.

Those principles are the focus of: How To Effectively Market and Manage An Accounting Firm

Your will learn:

The Accounting Firm Business Growth Process

The three step accounting firm business growth process:

- Generating new client
- Increasing the volume per transaction
- Increasing the frequency with which those clients hire you

The Client Attraction Process

The three step effective client attraction process:

- Crafting an effective marketing message
- Identifying the right target market
- Selecting the right media through which to channel your marketing message

What You Must Know About Your Accounting Firm Marketing

The ultimate key to accounting firm marketing:

- Psychology
- Mathematics

The skill that brought you out of Egypt cannot take you to the Promise Land.

You cannot succeed as an entrepreneur accountant with the skillset of an employee or with a CPA.

Learn the requisite skills and the process of growing your accounting firm from: How To Effectively Market And Manage An Accounting Firm.

CNBC and Strategy + Business Best Business Book of the Year

It’s the biggest revolution you’ve never heard of, and it’s hiding in plain sight. Over the past decade, Silicon Valley executives like Eric Schmidt and Elon Musk, Special Operators like the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets, and maverick scientists like Sasha Shulgin and Amy Cuddy have turned everything we thought we knew about high performance upside down. Instead of grit, better habits, or 10,000 hours, these trailblazers have found a surprising short cut. They're harnessing rare and controversial states of consciousness to solve critical challenges and outperform the competition. 

New York Times bestselling author Steven Kotler and high performance expert Jamie Wheal spent four years investigating the leading edges of this revolution—from the home of SEAL Team Six to the Googleplex, the Burning Man festival, Richard Branson’s Necker Island, Red Bull’s training center, Nike’s innovation team, and the United Nations’ Headquarters. And what they learned was stunning: In their own ways, with differing languages, techniques, and applications, every one of these groups has been quietly seeking the same thing: the boost in information and inspiration that altered states provide. 

Today, this revolution is spreading to the mainstream, fueling a trillion dollar underground economy and forcing us to rethink how we can all lead richer, more productive, more satisfying lives. Driven by four accelerating forces—psychology, neurobiology, technology and pharmacology—we are gaining access to and insights about some of the most contested and misunderstood terrain in history. Stealing Fire is a provocative examination of what’s actually possible; a guidebook for anyone who wants to radically upgrade their life."

Sylvia Porter

Unlike the quote provided above, seemingly reflective of  general opinion on family budgets

today, we will attempt to take a much more positive approach to budgeting, as a family oriented, user-friendly, financial management and planning tool and life-enabler.

However, when reflecting on family budgeting and inquiring as to why not more families are actually using it, it becomes self-evident that similar skepticism runs rampant and deep in reality and society, even globally so.

Once you start probing family budgets, expending time and energy researching the subject in-depth, it becomes quite clear, that most families are caught in a vicious, almost never-ending cycle of “What comes in must go out.”

Most families might feel that budgeting is a futile effort, unnecessarily burdening them with thoughts and ways, to go broke methodically and slowly, without the creature comforts and indulgences of our human modern-day society.

Others might voice that they feel as if they are merely throwing money away, in a never-ending and dizzying spiral of spend, spend, spend. People are getting deeper and deeper into debt, no matter how hard they try to get out of it. Questions are then raised : How do we stop these courses of action? How do we change the thinking around family fiscal discipline?

Put simply, in “How to set up a Family Budget”, we focus in on how to empower families to set up better, more realistic budgets, stick to them and celebrate their successes (and learn from their failures!)"

Although quickly banned by the French government, it was widely read and remains a classic and powerful indictment of torture.


“The lesson of this book... is that we are all on the edge of savagery and if we begin to slip over that edge, we fall fast and far.” — D. W. Brogan, The New York Times 


“Written with spare and simple candor, the book is much more than a scalding footnote to fever-hot headlines. The Question does not stop with the Algerian question but goes on to ask: What does it mean to be a human being? It tells of the shame and glory of man.” — Time


“In his modest, unassuming and precise fashion, Alleg is describing a triumph of the human spirit... The importance of Alleg’s book extends far beyond Algeria and France. For this is what can happen anywhere; what does happen in many parts of the world and what could happen here. There is nothing ‘inhuman’ about it. It is too, too human. To hush it up, to deny it for any reason whatever is to be an accomplice of the torturers...” — Scotsman


“[A] noble and in a sense ennobling book, the dominant impression it leaves is one of a progressive and finally an almost total degradation, a degradation both of persons — except for the tortured, the outlawed — and of social institutions. The Question is far more than an account of atrocities, however spectacular.” — The Nation"

Because their work spread beyond UCLA, the tradition lives on in the work of scores of economists who had no formal connection with the School. The most important economists at UCLA during the 1970s were Armen Alchian, Harold Demsetz, Sam Peltzman, Benjamin Klein, Robert Clower, Axel Leijonhufvud, Jack Hirshleifer, William Allen, and George Hilton.

A distinguishing feature of most of the UCLA economists’ contributions is that they were non-mathematical. This was especially notable in an era in which mathematics had almost taken over economics. The major UCLA School contributors used mainly words and occasionally graphs. Another distinguishing feature is their use of basic economic analysis to understand behaviour that had previously not been understood or had even been misunderstood. 

The best-known member of the School, Armen Alchian, taught at UCLA from 1946 until his retirement in 1984. His insights and writings underlie a distinctive theme of the School’s approach to economics: in most productive activity, the profit motive, combined with private property rights, successfully aligns the interests of producers and consumers, often in subtle ways. Alchian had no use for formal models that did not teach us to look somewhere new in the known world. Nor had he any patience for findings that relied on fancy statistical procedures. Alchian saw basic economics as a powerful tool for explaining much of human behaviour in both market and non-market settings. 

The second most prominent member of the UCLA School was Harold Demsetz, who made major contributions to the study of property rights and to regulation and antitrust policy. He argued that market concentration could reflect the superior efficiency of firms with large market shares primarily resulting from innovation or from economies of scale. Government efforts to break up large firms or restrain their growth was, therefore, likely to reduce innovation and economic efficiency, with consequent harm to consumers.

Other academic research at the UCLA School included Klein’s work in monetary theory, and Clower and Leijonhufvud’s work in macroeconomics. Another famous UCLA School economist was Thomas Sowell, who wrote his 1975 book Race and Economics, a precursor to his much more extensive work on the economics of various ethnic groups, while at UCLA."

The cofounder and chief branding officer of Red Antler, the branding and marketing company for startups and new ventures, explains how hot new brands like Casper, Allbirds, Sweetgreen, and Everlane build devoted fan followings right out of the gate.

We're in the midst of a startup revolution, with new brands popping up every day, taking over our Instagram feeds and vying for our affection. Every category is up for grabs, and traditional brands are seeing their businesses erode as hundreds of small companies encroach on their territory, each hoping to become the next runaway success. But it's not enough to have a great idea, or a cool logo. 

Emily Heyward founded Red Antler, the Brooklyn based brand and marketing company, to help entrepreneurs embed brand as a driver of business success from the beginning. In Obsessed, Heyward outlines the new principles of what it takes to build and launch a brand that has people queuing up to buy it on opening day. She takes you behind the scenes of the creation of some of today's hottest new brands, showing you:

  •  How Casper was able to upend the mattress industry by building a beloved brand where none had existed before 
  •  How the dating app Hinge won a fanatical user base and great word-of-mouth with the promise that the app was ""designed to be deleted""
  •  Why luggage startup Away, now valued at $1.4 billion, could build their brand around love of travel by launching with just one product--a hard-shell carry-on suitcase--rather than a whole range of luggage offerings.

Whether you're starting a new business, launching a new product line, or looking to refresh a brand for a new generation of customers, Obsessed shows you why the old rules of brand-building no longer apply, and what really works for today's customers."

The paranormal television series Stranger Things taps into the mysterious elements that have fueled spiritual questions for millennia. The otherworldly manifestations in Hawkins, Indiana offer compelling portrayals of important spiritual truths--and many of these truths are echoed in the supernatural worldview of the Bible.


For Michael Heiser, Stranger Things is the perfect marriage of his interest in popular culture and the paranormal. In The Unseen Realm, he opened the eyes of thousands, helping readers understand the supernatural worldview of the Bible. Now he turns his attention to the worldwide television phenomenon, exploring how Stranger Things relates to Christian theology and the Christian life. 


In The World Turned Upside Down, Heiser draws on this supernatural worldview to help us think about the story of Jesus and discover glimpses of the gospel in the Upside Down. He argues that this celebrated series helps us understand the gospel in unique and overlooked ways. The spiritual questions and crises raised by Stranger Things are addressed the same way they are in the gospel, with mystery and transcendent power."

It is the universe’s most famous and inspirational coalitions of all time. It has boldly gone where no pop culture franchise has gone before. It is the foundation for a thriving community of passionate fans.

Creator Gene Roddenberry said Star Trek “was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms . . . If we cannot learn to actually enjoy those small differences, to take a positive delight in those small differences between our own kind, here on this planet, then we do not deserve to go out into space and meet the diversity that is almost certainly out there.”
 
After more than 50 years, 11 television series, 13 movies, and countless fan conventions later, Star Trek fans of all ages continue to gather—in person or virtually-- and enjoy, share, and live up to Roddenberry’s optimistic vision of the future.
 
Fully authorized and filled with full-color images spanning the entire canon,  Star Trek: Starfleet is… celebrates of Roddenberry’s vision. This commemorative book highlights 50 of the key traits of the Star Trek universe and demonstrates, through memorable images and beautiful artwork, how these ideals are personified by everyone from Kirk and Spock, to Picard and Janeway, to Burnham and Mariner, and their voyages to everywhere from Earth to Vulcan, from Q’onoS to the Delta Quadrant, and even to the Mirror Universe and back in time—and how they are actively and sincerely lived by the Star Trek fans themselves. 
 
What is Starfleet? Starfleet is fun. Starfleet is not always logical. Starfleet is adventure. Starfleet is brave. Starfleet is compassion. Starfleet is diverse. Starfleet is evolving. 
 
And it is by sharing their passions, supporting one another through difficult times, celebrating one another’s successes, and boldly going into a bright and hopeful future that Star Trek fans show that, above all, Starfleet is family. Starfleet is forever.

She’d grown accustomed to shopping at outlet malls, discount stores like T.J. Maxx, and cheap but trendy retailers like Forever 21, Target, and H&M. She was buying a new item of clothing almost every week (the national average is sixty-four per year) but all she had to show for it was a closet and countless storage bins packed full of low-quality fads she barely wore—including the same sailor-stripe tops and fleece hoodies as a million other shoppers. When she found herself lugging home seven pairs of identical canvas flats from Kmart (a steal at $7 per pair, marked down from $15!), she realized that something was deeply wrong. 

Cheap fashion has fundamentally changed the way most Americans dress. Stores ranging from discounters like Target to traditional chains like JCPenney now offer the newest trends at unprecedentedly low prices. Retailers are pro­ducing clothes at enormous volumes in order to drive prices down and profits up, and they’ve turned clothing into a disposable good. After all, we have little reason to keep wearing and repairing the clothes we already own when styles change so fast and it’s cheaper to just buy more. 

But what are we doing with all these cheap clothes? And more important, what are they doing to us, our society, our environment, and our economic well-being? 

In Overdressed, Cline sets out to uncover the true nature of the cheap fashion juggernaut, tracing the rise of budget clothing chains, the death of middle-market and independent retail­ers, and the roots of our obsession with deals and steals. She travels to cheap-chic factories in China, follows the fashion industry as it chases even lower costs into Bangladesh, and looks at the impact (both here and abroad) of America’s drastic increase in imports. She even explores how cheap fashion harms the charity thrift shops and textile recyclers where our masses of cloth­ing castoffs end up.

Sewing, once a life skill for American women and a pathway from poverty to the middle class for workers, is now a dead-end sweatshop job. The pressures of cheap have forced retailers to drastically reduce detail and craftsmanship, making the clothes we wear more and more uniform, basic, and low quality. Creative inde­pendent designers struggle to produce good and sustainable clothes at affordable prices.

Cline shows how consumers can break the buy-and-toss cycle by supporting innovative and stylish sustainable designers and retailers, refash­ioning clothes throughout their lifetimes, and mending and even making clothes themselves.


Overdressed will inspire you to vote with your dollars and find a path back to being well dressed and feeling good about what you wear."

Winner of the Orwell Special Prize ‘On the Front Line’ is a collection of her finest work, a portion of the proceeds from which will go to the Marie Colvin Memorial Fund.

Marie Colvin held a profound belief in the pursuit of truth, and the courage and humanity of her work was deeply admired. On the Front Line includes her various interviews with Yasser Arafat and Colonel Gadaffi; reports from East Timor in 1999 where she shamed the UN into protecting its refugees; accounts of her terrifying escape from the Russian army in Chechnya; and reports from the strongholds of the Sri Lankan Tamil Tigers where she was hit by shrapnel, leaving her blind in one eye.

Typically, however, her new eye-patch only reinforced Colvin’s sense of humour and selfless conviction. She returned quickly to the front line, reporting on 9/11, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and, lately, the Arab Spring.

Immediate and compelling, On the Front Line is a street-view of the historic events that have shaped the last 25 years, from an award-winning foreign correspondent and the outstanding journalist of her generation.

Reviews

‘Here it all is, a vast Marie Colvin box set, poignant beyond words’ Guardian

Tributes to Marie Colvin:

John Witherow, Sunday Times editor: ‘She was somebody who was fun, full of life with joie de vivre and friends all over the world. During her time she saved many lives by highlighting the plight of victims of violence. Everywhere she had gone she tried to help people because she believed she was a witness to the violence that was going on and that she could make a difference’

Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch: ‘For Marie, covering war wasn't about doing a few quick interviews and writing up a quick story: she experienced war alongside those who suffered in war, and her writings had a particular vividness because of what she had dared to see and experience’

Lyse Doucet, BBC: ‘The world will miss her because she was the eyes and ears of so many. Marie always admired the pioneering journalism of fellow American Martha Gelhorn. I always saw her as the Martha of our generation: brave and beautiful’

Max Hastings, author of All Hell Let Loose: ‘All her life, all over the world, she was drawn to record the experiences of civilian victims, who found themselves living and dying in a universe from which compassion and justice had been banished…Colvin was killed doing her best thing, in full knowledge of its perils…This collection of words is her most appropriate memorial because it so vividly explains why her peers admired her so much’

About the author

Born in America, Marie Colvin (1956 – February 22, 2012) was an award-winning foreign affairs correspondent for the Sunday Times. An outstanding journalist of her generation, she covered the Middle East for more than 20 years and reported from East Timor, Chechnya, Kosovo and Sri Lanka where she was wounded in an ambush and lost her left eye. She was killed while covering the Siege of Homs in Syria on the 22nd of February 2012."

If you've already read Part One, you will understand your circumstances and attitude to risk, have calculated your cash reserves and determined your investor profile.
Now it's time to plan a personalised strategy for effective portfolio management tailored to your personality, lifestyle and desired returns.

Collectively, we are value investors. But we are also individuals who each has quite a different approach when it comes to how we choose to divide up our portfolios. Some of us are cautious investors who only want to buy into low risk, large cap businesses. Others are bold, equally happy to own shares in micro as large caps, exposed to greater risk for greater potential reward. There are yet more who fall somewhere between these two extremes idenfifying most with a mindful or confident profile.

Understanding who you are as an investor and determining your asset allocation model is just the beginning and already covered in Part One of this eBook. In Part Two, we move forward into the practical world of value investing, helping you to answer questions such as:

How exactly should you divide your equities section?
How many stocks should you own?
How much should you invest in each holding?
What should you do once those investment 'slices' start to grow?
When is the best time to sell a stock?
When should you react to news of an impending recession?

Based on our Long-term Profit (LTP) equation we have developed a portfolio management philosophy of principle over panic, facts over fear and allocation over activity. Using this to guide stock selection, slice size model and rebalancing strategy enables us to achieve consistent, market-beating returns; regardless of our personal specifics and investor profile.

Whatever your strategy, applying our philosophy to your portfolio management models steers you away from unnecessary impulsive activity that can have a serious impact on profits. We show you how to navigate a media that profits from doom, directing you to actual economic indicators that inform your decisions, inspiring intelligent actions that lower expenses and support great returns.

As well as lots of information, this eBook contains practical tools and advice to help you put your personalised portfolio management strategy to work:
Calculate the ideal slice size model for your equities
Learn how to adapt your portfolio around your changing circumstances
Easy steps to ceating a new portfolio or rebalance an existing one

Amateur investors made millions out of it, and its founders became billionaires. But professional investors steered clear, regarding it as over-valued.


In a few short years, the Australian startup Afterpay has put a rocket under consumer finance and birthed a global industry. It pioneered the four-payments model that allows customers to bypass credit cards for online shopping and budgeting, with the cost borne by the retailer. Just five years after it was founded, Afterpay had changed the way a generation went shopping, how brands from big banks to fashion labels win customers, and how institutions value companies. 


Buy Now, Pay Later recounts the dramatic behind-the-scenes story of the founding and rise of Afterpay. It reveals the network of business and personal relationships that enabled the company to finance its speedy growth and the manoeuvring that enabled it to escape regulation for years, as well as the near-death experiences and rising concern that it is getting young people hooked on debt. 


Drawing on years of on-the-ground reporting and interviews with key figures involved in their rollercoaster ride, this is the Afterpay story told in full for the first time.


Jonathan Shapiro and James Eyers report on banking and finance at The Australian Financial Review.


'A gripping success story with a colourful Sydney cast, a story of innovation, courage, lucky breaks and above all family.' - Malcolm Turnbull, former Prime Minister of Australia

The young heiress next busies herself with finding a suitable husband for her friend and protégé, Harriet Smith, setting off an entertaining sequence of comic mishaps and misunderstanding in this sparkling comedy of English-village romance. Beneath its considerable wit, the novel is also the story of a young woman’s progress toward self-understanding.
“Emma” abounds in the droll character sketches at which Jane Austen excelled. In addition to the well-intentional heroine and her hypochondriacal father, the village of Highbury during the Regency period is populated by an amusing circle of friends and family — kindhearted but tedious Miss Bates, a chatterbox spinster; ambitious Mr. Elton, a social-climbing parson; Frank Churchill, an enigmatic Romeo; Mr. Knightley, Emma’s brother-in-law and the voice of her better nature; and a cluster of other finely drawn, unforgettable personalities.
The author’s skill at depicting the follies of human nature in a manner both realistic and affectionate elevates this tale of provincial matchmaking to the heights of scintillating satire.

Of all great writers, Jane Austen is the most difficult to catch in the act of greatness. —Virginia Woolf
Jane Austen’s masterpiece. —Rex Stout
Jane Austen is my favourite author! I read and reread, the mouth open and the mind closed. —E. M. Forster
How could these novels ever seem remote... the gaiety is unextinguished today, the irony has kept its bite, the reasoning is still sweet, the sparkle undiminished, as comedies they are irresistibly and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be. —Eudora Welty

Macbeth fully The Tragedy of Macbeth, is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. It was probably first performed in 1606.

James VI and I was patron of Shakespeare's playing company, and some people[who? say that Macbeth is the play which most clearly indicates Shakespeare's relationship with him.


In the play, Macbeth is a Scottish general under the rule of King Duncan. Three witches tell Macbeth that he will become king of Scotland.

That even your best efforts to craft an amazing resumé fail. You spend days searching for the perfect position, polishing your resumé and crafting the perfect cover letter. But after all that hard work what do you get in return?  

 

Nothing.  

 

No invite to interview and rarely even a rejection letter.  

 

And that’s what’s most frustrating. That after all your hard work there’s zero recognition. No constructive criticism and nothing to help you improve.  

 

You’ve spent hours creating a document which has accomplished nothing but you being completely ignored.  

 

So what is it you’re doing wrong?  

 

The truth: A lot.  

 

The majority of resumé advice you’ve received is wrong. A good resumé is not just a list of the jobs you’ve held in the past or a rundown of your skills. A good resumé highlights your achievements and helps you stand out as the ideal candidate for the job.  

 

The good news?  

 

Together we’re going to transform your resumé from a simple list of past duties into an achievement focused, compelling letter that won’t just get a response from recruiters, but will get the response you want.  

 

An invite to interview.  

 

Your resumé is the most important element in finding a new job. A good resumé gets your foot in the door. It makes recruiters want to invite you to interview to you to find out more. It’s the first, and most crucial, step in selling yourself as the best candidate for the job.  

 

In this book you’ll learn a step-by-step method for creating a resumé that cannot fail to impress. A method that I’ve used as a professional copywriter to create winning resumés and corporate bios for dozens of high level employees in multinational firms.  

 

There’s nothing generic or ambiguous in this guide. Each chapter offers actionable advice and walks you through the exact steps you need to take to ensure your resumé is the best it can be.  

 

Download this book and within a few days you’ll have the competitive edge to stand out from the crowd with a resumé that makes recruiters want you.  

 

In this book you’ll learn:  

 

•	The fundamental problem with popular resumé advice - How the advice you’ve heard is holding you back and the different approach that’s guaranteed to capture recruiter attention.  

•	The secrets of effective resumé design - Using scientific studies you’ll learn where recruiters attention is most focused.  

•	The secrets of effective research - Knowing that a company is hiring isn’t enough. You’ll learn how to discover what particular traits, skills and achievements that business most highly values  

•	Turning your research into a targeted, compelling resumé - Knowing what a company wants and knowing how to demonstrate you fit their needs are two different skills. You’ll learn how to quickly and easily establish yourself as the ideal candidate.  

•	A few professional editing tricks - Recruiters are busy. They don’t have time to read through paragraph after paragraph of information. In this section you’ll learn how to edit your resumé to make the same statement in as few words as possible for maximum impact. 

•	The all important final check - A few tips on how to finally check your resumé to ensure there’s no errors and it’s as good as it can possibly be.

Coronavirus hammered some of them flat. Yet he’s fine with that. Because when the chaos is swirling and shit is getting real, there’s opportunity. Now is the time to put yourself in control – where no boss or virus can take you down.

So many talented people want to give it a shot, yet they’re held back by the big business myths. But success is simpler than your crusty CEO wants you to think. Ian built his businesses on simple rules, Year 6 maths, basic decency and no jargon. It generated profits that made the bank people say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before.’

Ian’s advice is so readable that many of his readers have no interest in commerce, they just like his dry humour and guidance on living a better life. He takes you step-by-step through the whole entrepreneur experience, from the day you open the doors through to when you pay others to run the place for you. 

There are 60 short and often surprising chapters in the trademark style of his popular 'Motivation for Sceptics' blog, from ‘Your Success Goals Are Built on Lies’ to ‘Business Whack-A-Mole Skills’ and ‘Remote Work Sucks Unless You're Old’.

Whether you’re running your own business, leading someone else’s or freelancing, Undisruptable is the only handbook you need. And one you’ll actually enjoy reading to the end."

You might know my previous book, The Coaching Habit. It was an unexpected bestseller: more than 700,000 copies sold so far, 1,000+ 5-star reviews on Amazon (my favourite: ""I have plodded through many books that wish they could be this book""), a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and used by people and organizations around the world.So I've been sweating on the follow-up. The pressure! The anticipation! But here it is, and I think you're going to like it. If The Coaching Habit says, “here are the seven essential questions to be more coach-like,” The Advice Trap is about getting to grips with how to actually change your behaviour so you stay curious a little bit longer.It sounds like it should be easy, but it's not. You have to tame your Advice Monster, that part of you that jumps in to offer up ideas, opinions, suggestions and advice. And it's taming your Advice Monster that's at the heart of this book. But there are also some specific coaching strategies, particularly on how to focus on what matters most. There are tools to make your conversations, coaching and otherwise, irresistible. There are even resources beyond the book itself, including a one-year, free leadership program from a 52-person faculty of cool, diverse, and provocative thinkers.In 2019, I was named the #1 Thought Leader in Coaching, and was short-listed for the coaching award by Thinkers50, the “Oscars of Management.” My work's been featured in journals such as HBR, Fast Company, Forbes, and Inc., and my company, Box of Crayons, has trained more than 100,000 people just like you in the tools and mindset required for this essential leadership behaviour: being more coach-like. You'll get all of that wisdom and experience when you read The Advice Trap. I'm pretty sure you'll find it a great investment of your money and time. (And, by the way, thank you in advance for buying it. I'm thrilled to know the book is going out into the world.)"

And they are making millions.

If you use the wrong words to talk about your product, nobody will buy it. Marketers and business owners struggle to effectively connect with their customers, costing them and their companies millions in lost revenue.

In a world filled with constant, on-demand distractions, it has become near-impossible for business owners to effectively cut through the noise to reach their customers, something Donald Miller knows first-hand. In this book, he shares the proven system he has created to help you engage and truly influence customers.

The StoryBrand process is a proven solution to the struggle business leaders face when talking about their companies. Without a clear, distinct message, customers will not understand what you can do for them and are unwilling to engage, causing you to lose potential sales, opportunities for customer engagement, and much more.

In Building a StoryBrand, Donald Miller teaches marketers and business owners to use the seven universal elements of powerful stories to dramatically improve how they connect with customers and grow their businesses.

Are you sick of the rat race? The 9 to 5 grind? How much would it change your life to add an additional $100-$200 a week to your life? Or how about $1000? Whatever your motivations might be, and whether you want to earn millions (or just an extra couple hundred a week), I’m sharing with you my most favorite 7 passive income streams, just because of their ease and relative simple startup.

I think I speak for most people in saying that 99.9% of people truly don’t do a job they truly love, or have a passion for… but with passive income streams you begin to free up your time, which is awesome. This means that you’re able to spend more time doing the things you love, or spending more time with the people that matter the most to you.

At the end of the day, you are the only one that can change your own life, and in truth, your destiny is in your own hands. It’s true, I’ve always had the philosophy that if anyone else can do it, then I can to; and this applies to all human beings. Did you know that your mind is the most powerful asset you have? And that, in essence, anything you think of and have a burning desire for, that becomes a very part of your being that you will undoubtedly obtain…

Forget the old concept of retirement (and the rest of the deferred-life plan). Now, there is no need to wait, and every reason not to, especially in these unpredictable, economic times.

Inside You Will Discover:

- Vending Machines (a 30-billion dollar, US industry)
- Kindle Publishing (making money from books you never wrote)
- Merch by Amazon (uploading digital art and letting Amazon do the rest)
- Real Estate Investing (a recession-proof, passive income as an asset)
- Mobile Apps (the expediential increase as people move more toward mobile devices; now, and more than ever)
- Investing in Dividend Stocks (there’s a reason that most, if not all millionaires and billionaires, own stocks as a necessity)
- Affiliate Marketing (an extremely profitable way of making money that you can do on autopilot)

This book will familiarize the user with these different avenues as a beginner, as well as include some resources I have found and used myself. Yes, these are the ones that will help you greatly if you decide to choose any given option.

Remember, “It’s not about ideas. It’s about making ideas happen!” So, what are you waiting for?"

""When I saw this book I was very curious to find out how people can make extra money by selling things they can get for free. It sounded too good to be true, but now I know it is possible, easy to do, and, more importantly, anyone can start their own business like this.

I like the fact that the author talks about his own experience and gives details on how he started his business and expanded it. The book is very well structured, easy to read, enjoyable and motivating. It's a great guide that explains all the steps you need to take in order to find items that people would usually throw away, and sell them on eBay or Amazon. The author also gives a huge list of items that can bring a generous income, but the best thing is that it teaches the readers how to find their own items and become experts at spotting something that would bring them money."""

You can turn any warm or cold prospect into a hot prospect, wanting to know all about your business.

How?

By learning how to effectively introduce your business into a social conversation with an easy, rejection-free sequence of just a few words.

Prospects want what you have to offer, but they are afraid of someone selling them. However, prospects love to buy and join. So why not use socially acceptable word sequences that compel any prospect to literally beg you for a presentation?

This book contains several effective formulas with many examples of each formula that you can use or modify. Once we know how the formulas work, we can create unlimited Ice Breakers on-demand to use and pass on to our downline. Your distributors will no longer be afraid of prospecting; instead, they will love prospecting.

It is much more fun when we are in control. Distributors want to work hard, but just don't know what to say. Their opening random remarks ruin their chances and they suffer bad experiences. That experience trains them to avoid prospecting.

But with trained words and phrases, everything changes. Quick and positive results. Prospecting is fun again.

Enjoy learning how to prospect negative people, positive people, relatives, co-workers, strangers, leads, cold prospects ... anyone, by using fun Ice Breakers that even the prospects enjoy. Spend the entire week giving presentations, instead of spending the entire week looking for someone to talk to.

And never again will you have to hear one of your distributors complain, ""I just don't have anyone to talk to.""

Ice Breakers are the best way to energize your MLM and network marketing business."

The beloved show Friends introduced the world to six young New Yorkers living together, falling in love, breaking up (cue Ross's ""We were on a break!""), and getting into hilarious shenanigans, which became an instant classic formula that inspired dozens of ""hangout sitcoms"" long after the show's reign. But no sitcom has ever come close to the series that started it all, spawning iconic looks like ""the Rachel"" and timeless catchphrases like ""How you doin'?"" while creating a cultural sensation that catapulted the cast members to instant mega-stardom.

Throughout the show's ten- season run, viewers watched Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey navigate their twenties and thirties with unwavering friendship, determination, and, of course, plenty of sarcasm. Friends Forever takes fans back to the set where it all began with exclusive photos of the sitcom that won four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series, eleven People's Choice Awards, and a Golden Globe for Jennifer Aniston for Best Lead Actress in a Television Series. This fully illustrated episode guide will treat readers to nostalgic flashbacks of the top one hundred episodes and sneak peeks of how popularly referenced lines from the show came to be. Friends Forever also boasts new interviews with show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman on how the show got its start and set designer John Shaffner who reveals his inspirations behind the iconic looks behind Monica’s and Rachel’s apartment and Central Perk. 

It's no wonder why the Friends cast was chosen by TV Guide readers as the Best Comedy cast of all time, while countless other publications such as Vanity Fair named the show one of the best sitcoms of all time.

Fun, hilarious interactives include:
Joey’s fake resume vs real one Countdown to the funniest Thanksgiving foods Trivia game Q&A from ""The One with the Embryos"" (Seriously, what is Chandler Bing’s job?) Follow Ross’s infidelity trail from ""The One with the Morning After"" Who’s that celebrity? A comprehensive guide to some of the most famous celebrity guest stars from all ten seasons"

But until now, those exercise books filled with her thoughts, observations, frustrations and joys have been locked away, out of bounds, in a laundry cupboard. 

Finally, Garner has opened her diaries and invited readers into the world behind her novels and works of non-fiction. Recorded with frankness, humour and steel-sharp wit, these accounts of her everyday life provide an intimate insight into the work of one of Australia’s greatest living writers.

Yellow Notebook, Diaries Volume One, in this elegant hardback edition, spans about a decade beginning in the late 1970s just after the publication of her first novel, Monkey Grip. It will delight Garner fans and those new to her work alike.


Helen Garner writes novels, stories, screenplays and works of non-fiction. In 2006 she received the inaugural Melbourne Prize for Literature, and in 2016 she won the prestigious Windham–Campbell Prize for non-fiction and the Western Australian Premier’s Book Award. In 2019 she was honoured with the Australia Council Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature. Her books include Monkey Grip, The Spare Room, This House of Grief and Everywhere I Look.


‘Garner is scrupulous, painstaking, and detailed, with sharp eyes and ears. She is everywhere at once, watching and listening, a recording angel at life’s secular apocalypses…her unillusioned eye makes her clarity compulsive.’ James Wood, New Yorker

‘On the page, Garner is uncommonly fierce, though this usually has the effect on me of making her seem all the more likeable. I relish her fractious, contrarian streak – she wears it as a chef would a bloody apron – even as I worry about what it would be like to have to face it down.’ Guardian

‘[Garner’s] writing expresses a hard-won grace. It brings you closer to the world, and shows you how to love it.’ Monthly"

Thirty years ago, Jack Trout and Al Ries published their classic bestseller, Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind—a book that revolutionized the world of marketing. But times have changed. Competition is fiercer. Consumers are savvier. Communications are faster. And once-successful companies are in crisis mode.

Repositioning shows you how to adapt, compete—and succeed—in today’s overcrowded marketplace. Global marketing expert Jack Trout has retooled his most effective positioning strategies—providing a must-have arsenal of proven marketing techniques specifically redesigned for our current climate. With Repositioning, you can conquer the “3 Cs” of business: Competition, Change, and Crisis . . .


 BEAT THE COMPETITION: Challenge your rivals, differentiate your product, increase your value, and stand out in the crowd.

CHANGE WITH THE TIMES: Use the latest technologies, communications, and multimedia resources to connect with your consumers.

MANAGE A CRISIS: Cope with everything from profi t losses and rising costs to bad press and PR nightmares.




Even if your company is doing well, these cutting-edge marketing observations can keep you on top of your game and ahead of the pack. You’ll discover how expanding product lines may decrease your overall sales, why new brand names often outsell established brands, and why slashing prices is usually a bad idea. You’ll learn the dangers of attacking your competitors head-on—and the value of emphasizing value. You’ll see how consumers can have too many choices to pick from—and what you can do to make them pick your brand.

Drawing from the latest research studies, consumer statistics, and business-news headlines, Trout reveals the hidden psychological motives that drive today’s market. Understanding the mindset of your consumers is half the battle. Winning in today’s world is often a matter of repositioning. It’s how you rethink the strategies you’ve always relied on. It’s how you regain the success you’ve worked so hard for. It’s how you win the new battle of the mind."

“Coaches rely far too much on asking open-ended questions,” says Marcia Reynolds. But questions only seek answers—inquiry provides insight. When, instead of just questions, clients hear their thoughts, opinions, and beliefs spoken by someone else, it prompts them to critically consider how their thinking affects their goals. Reynolds cites the latest brain science to show why reflective inquiry works and provides techniques, tips, and structures for creating breakthrough conversations. 

This book will free coaches from the cult of asking the magical question by offering five essential practices of reflective inquiry: focus on the person, not the problem; summarize what is heard and expressed; identify underlying beliefs and assumptions; unwrap the desired outcome; and articulate insights and commitments. Using these practices, combined with a respectful and caring presence, helps create a space where clients feel safe, seen, and valued for who they are. Coaches become change agents who actively recharge the human spirit. And clients naturally dive deeper and develop personalized solutions that may surprise even the coach."

However, many project managers' areas of expertise lie outside the perimeters of business, and most do not have the formal education in business, accounting, or finance required to take their skills to the next level. In order to succeed, today's project managers (PMs) who wish to soar to the top or remain at the helm of their profession need to have a comprehensive grasp of the business context within which they work. Providing a resourceful introduction to the interrelationships between finance, accounting, and Project Management, Project Management Accounting, Second Edition is designed to help PMs at various skill levels improve their business skills, provide advanced contributions to their organizations, and perform with greater proficiency.

Authors and industry experts Kevin Callahan, Gary Stetz, and Lynne Brooks combine their decades of Project Management experience and insights to provide professionals in the field with a 360-degree understanding of how costs interact with the general ledger. Through the authors' seasoned expertise, PMs are better equipped to assess all facets of a project with a broader understanding of the ""big picture"" to determine whether to continue as planned, find an alternative solution, or scrap the project altogether.

Rich with new content as well as many new case studies, this Second Edition of Project Management Accounting includes:
 Updated information on Project Management and its link to Project Accounting A new chapter on assessing risk when managing projects How to determine the greatest tax/cost savings Project Management in relation to a company's mission, objectives, and strategy Project Management in an agile business Coverage of agile Project Management as applied to software and technical projects New, updated, and timely case studies Sample checklists to help readers get started and apply concepts to their business  
Project managers must make vital decisions every day that impact the schedule, costs, or resources committed to a given project. Project Management Accounting, Second Edition, provides the tools and skills to help PMs establish with greater certainty whether these costs should be capitalized or expensed to stay on budget and improve a company's bottom line."

Have you ever had a new idea or a goal that excites you... but not enough time to execute it? What about a goal you really want to accomplish...but can't because instead of taking action, you procrastinate? Do you feel like the only way things are going to get done is if you do them? But what if it wasn't that way? What if you had a team of people around you that helped you accomplish your goals (while you helped them accomplish theirs)? 

When we want something done, we've been trained to ask ourselves: ""How can I do this?"" Well, there is a better question to ask. One that unlocks a whole new world of ease and accomplishment. Expert coach Dan Sullivan knows the question we should ask instead: ""Who can do this for me?""

This may seem simple. And it is. But don't let the lack of complexity fool you. By mastering this question, you will quickly learn how billionaires and successful entrepreneurs like Dan build incredible businesses and personal freedom. 

This book will teach you how to make this essential paradigm-shift so you can:
  •  Build a successful business effectively while not killing yourself
  •  Immediately free-up 1,000+ hours of work that you shouldn't be doing anyway
  •  Bypass the typical scarcity and decline of aging and other societal norms
  •  Increase your vision in all areas of life and build teams of WHOs to support you in that vision
  •  Never be limited in your goals and ambitions again
  •  Expand your abundance of wealth, innovation, relationships, and joy
  •  Build a life where everything you do is your choice--how you spend your time, how much money you make, the quality of your relationships, and the type of work you do 

Making this shift involves retraining your brain to stop limiting your potential based on what you solely can do and instead focus on the nearly infinite and endless connections between yourself and other people as well as the limitless transformation possible through those connections."

Since solar power is effectively an infinite source of clean energy, its the only real choice that we have to avoid running out of energy globally now that our civilization is so large. Solar power is also the lowest cost energy source."

Did you know that you are likely to be lied to about 2-3 times in a short conversation of 10 minutes? It turns out that 91% of people lie many times throughout the day at work and at home. And you would be surprised that most people don't even have a clue that they are lied to. Why?

When we talk we say very little because it's our body that does the real talking! We express so much more subconsciously through our physical behavior, body posture, gestures, eye movement, facial expressions, touch and the use of space. So why not learn how to use this to your advantage? Or just take time to read about because it is very interesting. Successful people utilize their nonverbal cues to get what they want depending on the given circumstances. Understanding the body language comes easy to some, while others can't figure it out. Whether you're in the first or in the second group, with this book, you will not only learn how to understand non-verbal signals, you will master them. Loaded with practical tips, this book covers everything you ever need to know about body language, in a variety of business situations. The author covers everything from gestures and postures to personal and physical space.

You can learn to read the many forms of body language in people's hands, legs, eyes, and faces. This skill is especially useful if you're interested in dating.

There are only two enduring characteristics of being wealthy: {1} relativity, that is, owning hundreds of times more stuff or money than average people do, regardless of what this average value is, and {2} exclusivity, i.e., being a part of a tiny fraction of the population (for example, the top 0.02%).

This text explains why wealth requires luck and why the only way to get rich is to get lucky. Because luck is beyond anyone's control, 99.98% of people won't become wealthy no matter how hard they try. For example, a moderate and limited correlation exists between IQ and income, but there is no correlation between IQ and net worth. These data suggest that wealth is either a result of pure luck or has to do with mental abilities unrelated to IQ (for instance, an entrepreneurial talent). The latter explanation also involves luck because a person can neither learn nor earn a talent. The correlation between hard work and income is weak and limited. Higher net worth correlates with fewer hours worked per year.

For this reason, it's a bad idea to prepay for advice on how to get rich because this kind of advice is always useless. If you knew how to make a million dollars easily and quickly, would you let somebody else have this pile of money in exchange for 20 bucks? Careful analysis shows that for someone who has an excellent business idea, it is much more profitable to hire you as an employee than to sell you the info on how to start the biz. Therefore, it's unwise to pay in advance for the information on how to start a successful business. The text also discusses several other disadvantageous ways to invest your money. In addition, this ebook discusses some low-risk approaches to starting a business and to building wealth, but this information does not guarantee anything thanks to Lady Luck."

Friends and Rivals is a vivid and engaging account of the intersecting and entwined lives of Ethel Turner, author of the much loved Seven Little Australians, Barbara Baynton, who wrote of the harshness of bush life, Nettie Palmer, essayist and critic, and Henry Handel Richardson, of The Getting of Wisdom and The Fortunes of Richard Mahoney fame. 

Brenda Niall illuminates a fascinating time in Australia’s literary history and brings to life the remarkable women who made it so.

Brenda Niall is one of Australia’s foremost biographers. She is the author of five award-winning biographies, including her acclaimed accounts of the Boyd family and her portrait of the Durack sisters, True North. In 2016 she won the Australian Literature Society’s Gold Medal and the National Biography Award for Mannix. In 2004 she was awarded the Order of Australia for ‘services to Australian literature, as an academic, biographer and literary critic’.

‘Deeply absorbing, fascinating and moving…now for the first time I have a sense of the women behind me…I loved the tone—detached and masterly but with a light touch, and a wit that’s sharp but never cruel: and always sympathetically attuned to the strain of the women’s attempts to find a balance between their inner and outer lives.’ Helen Garner

‘Few other writers have such an ability to understand and describe the relationships that create the characters of her subjects.’ Sydney Morning Herald

‘Among living Australian biographers, only Philip Ayres matches Brenda Niall for painstaking research serving narratives at once spirited and judicious…Dr Niall ignores nothing.’ Spectator"

Most business leaders understand the power of a dynamic, positive culture—but almost every effort to change culture fails. Why? The approach is often all wrong. Rather than attempt to “transform” a new culture from the ground up, leaders need to instead spearhead a culture renovation. It’s all about keeping what works, changing what needs to be changed, and ensuring proper care and maintenance—much like refurbishing and living in a beautiful historic home and improving its overall value.

In Culture Renovation, the head of the world’s leading HR research firm—the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp)—Kevin Oakes provides tangible, tactical insights drawn from a robust data set and informed by CEOs and HR leaders at many of the world’s top companies. You’ll find everything you need to rebuild your corporate culture with care and expertise, including:
Three phases and detailed action steps for architecting the change you want to see

Practical insights and examples from T-Mobile, Microsoft, 3M, and other top companies

The traits of a healthy corporate culture

Proven talent practices to maintain your new culture for long-term success




Oakes identifies 18 proven leadership actions for turning any culture into an agile, resilient, and innovative high-performance organization. You’ll learn how to best understand the culture in place today and set a new cultural path for decades to come; develop a co-creation mindset; identify influencers and blockers; ferret out skeptics and non-believers; measure, monitor, and report progress; and implement “next practices” in talent strategies to sustain the renovation.

Culture Renovation delivers everything you need to plan, build, and maintain a corporate culture that drives profits, growth, and business sustainability now and well into the future."

is that rich people have more money.” – Dave Thyfault

You may not aspire to become a millionaire, but wouldn’t it be nice to end up better off than 97% of our citizens, who depend on others for their retirement in one way or the other? Wouldn’t it be nice to live a better life along the way? Wouldn’t it be nice to do all of that without taking advantage of others or having to get a part-time job, or having to invest a fortune in time or money?
This is the type of information that this book offers you. In addition, you will find out that nearly everybody, including you, can have an extra half-million dollars at retirement. You don’t have to get another job and you don’t have to make big sacrifices. All you have to do is learn how to better utilize the money you make right now.
Once you understand what it takes to accumulate income and net worth, you might even find out what it takes to make that first million. In fact, there are millions of millionaires in America right now and it is not really all that difficult to become one. If you want to avoid suffering through the pain and discomfort of total financial collapse, you should read this book.

If you are Bill Gates, Donald Trump, or Warren Buffet, you are excused.

Writing for the ""boob tube"" didn’t even cross his mind. But he ended up in L.A. in the late 80’s, when television writers were experiencing their equivalent of a gold rush. After the billion- dollar syndication of Seinfeld, when studios were paying astronomical amounts of money to writers to create the next Friends or ER, the sudden mania for scripted entertainment made the TV writer a hot commodity. He found himself meeting with big agents, inside primetime story rooms, pitch meetings, and on the set of some of TVs most popular shows, and making more money than he’d ever thought possible.

Weaving his personal story with television’s, Stepakoff takes us behind the scenes to show what it’s like to have a story idea one week and see it come to life and be seen by millions of people just a week later. Stepakoff also takes us inside the industry to explain what we’re watching and why by exploring the growing problems of media consolidation, the effects of interference from executives, the lack of diversity, and what reality television is doing to quality scripted television.

When the market crashed and the dust settled, TV executives and the media conglomerates they worked for were sitting on a broken business model. Slowly, a new programming idea began to take hold—what if the writer and their salaries were removed from the equation? Reality TV was born and the TV writer suddenly became obsolete— at least temporarily."

My Story
After college, I did what you’re supposed to do: I got a job.
The problem was almost immediately I found myself looking for a way out. It wasn’t that I hated the work or my coworkers, but it just wasn’t what I wanted to do with my life. The thought of spending my next 30 years there was terrifying.
So evenings and weekends I turned my attention online. I’d been dabbling with building rudimentary websites, learning online advertising channels, and even running my own small marketing campaigns for other company’s products to test the waters.
And that’s what The Side Hustle Path is about; finding a low-risk way make more money.
If you’re looking for a get-rich-quick-scheme or the secret to overnight success, you won’t find it here. But what you will find are 10 down-to-earth entrepreneurs who were once sitting in your same position. They felt the same fears and uncertainties, but took action anyway.

The founder of Menlo Innovations and author of the business culture cult classic Joy, Inc offers an inspirational guide to leaders seeking joy in the challenge of leading others.

Rich Sheridan's Joy, Inc. told the story of how his tiny software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan achieved success and renown by embracing offbeat culture and human-centered values. In Chief Joy Officer, he turns his attention from culture to leadership, and draws on his experience running Menlo and consulting elsewhere to offer a wise, provocative guide on how anyone can build leadership capacity for joy within their own organization. 

Chief Joy Officer offers sage, hard-won advice to any manager or leader who yearns to make more of an impact on the lives of others, including:

  *  Self-understanding is the cornerstone for every virtue of leadership: authenticity, trust, humility, and optimism.

  *  Good leaders make more leaders: Learn to judge your performance not on whether people are doing what they're told, but whether they're developing independent leadership capacity.

  *  Influencing up is just as important is influencing down: how to encourage different thinking in those above you in your organizations.

Filled with colorful anecdotes from Sheridan's personal journey and wisdom from many leadership mentors, Chief Joy Officer offers an approachable, down-to-earth philosophy and practice that will help even the most disillusioned of middle managers bring a renewed sense of purpose to their work building others."

You need to do more than just create a ""project schedule"". You have to plan for the resources, equipment, money and communications needed to deliver your project on time. It’s a lot of work. So learn how to do it easily by reading this book on the 10 simple steps to project planning.

To plan a project, you need to do more than just create a schedule. You need to plan resources, finances, equipment, risks and project communications to name a few. Written by the Directors of ProjectManager.com this book will take you through the Project Planning process so that you can plan for all of the items step-by-step. Here are some snippets from the book…

Create a Project Plan

The creation of a comprehensive Project Plan is critical to the success of the project. The Project Plan identifies the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) of processes, activities and tasks to be undertaken to complete the project. It identifies the sequencing, duration and dependencies of tasks as well as the generic resources and financial expenditures required to complete the project.

Create a Resource Plan

Following the creation of a Project Plan, a detailed assessment of the resources required to undertake the project should be made. The required labor, equipment and materials should be listed and the amount of each resource quantified. Finally, the resource usage should be scheduled to provide the Project Manager with a complete view of the total amount of resources needed for each stage of the project.

Create a Financial Plan

The Financial Plan describes the total quantity of financial resources required during each stage of the project. The total cost of each item of labor, equipment and materials is calculated, as well as the total cost of undertaking each activity within the Project Plan.

Create a Quality Plan

To ensure that the project deliverables meet customer requirements, a Quality Plan is developed. This plan explicitly lists the quality targets to be achieved, and a suite of Quality Assurance and Quality Control activities are scheduled to ensure that the required level of quality is achieved throughout the project.

Create a Risk Plan

Managing Project Risk is a critical process within the Project Lifecycle. To mitigate risk effectively, all foreseeable project risks are identified and rated in terms of their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the project. The risks are prioritized and a set of actions identified to reduce the likelihood of each risk and its impact on the project should it occur.

Create an Acceptance Plan

The key to customer satisfaction is in gaining approval from the customer that the deliverables meet the quality criteria stated in the Quality Plan. To ensure that customer acceptance is sought for each deliverable produced by the project, an Acceptance Plan is created. The Acceptance Plan provides a schedule of Acceptance Reviews which are undertaken to gain customer acceptance for the completion of each deliverable within the project.

Create a Communication Plan

A Communications Plan is a document which describes the information to be provided to project stakeholders to keep them informed of the progress of the project. Each stakeholder is listed and their requirements for information clearly identified. A schedule of communication events and activities are laid out to ensure that the right information is communicated to the right people at the right time."

Blockchains have shown that trusted records, or ledgers, of permanent data can be stored on the Internet in a decentralized manner. The decentralization of the recording process is expected to significantly economize the cost of transactions.

Creating a ledger on data, a blockchain makes it possible to designate the owner of each piece of data, to trade data pieces, and to market them. This book examines the formation of markets for various types of data from the theory of market quality proposed and developed by M. Yano. Blockchains are expected to give data itself the status of a new production factor. Bringing ownership of data to the hands of data producers, blockchains can reduce the possibility of information leakage, enhance the sharing and use of IoT data, and prevent data monopoly and misuse.

The industry will have a bright future as soon as better technology is developed and when a healthy infrastructure is created to support the blockchain market."

 From Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Jesse Eisinger, “a fast moving, fly-on-the-wall, disheartening look at the deterioration of the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission…It is a book of superheroes” (San Francisco Review of Books).

Why were no bankers put in prison after the financial crisis of 2008? Why do CEOs seem to commit wrongdoing with impunity? The problem goes beyond banks deemed “Too Big to Fail” to almost every large corporation in America—to pharmaceutical companies and auto manufacturers and beyond. The Chickenshit Club—an inside reference to prosecutors too scared of failure and too daunted by legal impediments to do their jobs—explains why in “an absorbing financial history, a monumental work of journalism…a first-rate study of the federal bureaucracy” (Bloomberg Businessweek).

Jesse Eisinger begins the story in the 1970s, when the government pioneered the notion that top corporate executives, not just seedy crooks, could commit heinous crimes and go to prison. He brings us to trading desks on Wall Street, to corporate boardrooms and the offices of prosecutors and FBI agents. These revealing looks provide context for the evolution of the Justice Department’s approach to pursuing corporate criminals through the early 2000s and into the Justice Department of today, including the prosecutorial fiascos, corporate lobbying, trial losses, and culture shifts that have stripped the government of the will and ability to prosecute top corporate executives.

“Brave and elegant…a fearless reporter…Eisinger’s important and profound book takes no prisoners” (The Washington Post). Exposing one of the most important scandals of our time, The Chickenshit Club provides a clear, detailed explanation as to how our Justice Department has come to avoid, bungle, and mismanage the fight to bring these alleged criminals to justice. “This book is a wakeup call…a chilling read, and a needed one” (NPR.org)."

It premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month. The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879.

The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman, who at the time in Norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male dominated world. It aroused a great sensation at the time, and caused a “storm of outraged controversy” that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society."

 Although many books and literary analyses have been written about Anne Frank’s life and diary, none have explored the surprising influence she has had on young people in countries all over the world, helping to shape their moral framework and giving them critical life skills. This is due in part to the merits of a traveling exhibition created by the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam in 1985, which has so far been seen by over nine million people. The Anne Frank exhibition, along with its innovative educational and cultural activities, has circumnavigated the globe many times.
  
 In this fascinating study, Gillian Walnes Perry explores the various legacies of Anne Frank’s influence. She looks at the complex life of Anne Frank’s father and the motivations that powered his educational philosophy. She shares new insights into the real Anne Frank, personally gifted by those who actually knew her. Global icons such as Nelson Mandela and Audrey Hepburn relate the influence that Anne Frank had on shaping their own lives.
  
 This book presents—all in one place and for the very first time—the inspirational stories of a diverse variety of people from all over the world, brought together by the words of one particularly articulate and inspiring teenage victim of the Holocaust."

Kritik der politischen Ökonomie, eines der Hauptwerke von Karl Marx, ist eine Analyse und Kritik der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft mit weitreichenden Wirkungen in der Arbeiterbewegung und der Geschichte des 20. Jahrhunderts. Nach Jahrzehnten ökonomischer Studien und diversen Vorarbeiten erschien 1867 der erste Band: Der Produktionsprozess des Kapitals. Friedrich Engels stellte nach Marx' Tod (1883) aus dessen Manuskripten zwei weitere Bände zusammen. 1885 veröffentlichte er Band 2: Der Zirkulationsprozess des Kapitals. 1894 folgte Band 3: Der Gesamtprozess der kapitalistischen Produktion. Marx' Kritik legt dar, dass es sich bei Gesellschaften mit kapitalistischer Produktionsweise um Klassengesellschaften handle, in denen sich das Privateigentum an den Produktionsmitteln durch die Indienstnahme von Lohnarbeit vermehrt. So würde sich der Reichtum in Form von Kapital akkumulieren, während seine Produzenten dauerhaft von ihm ausgeschlossen wären: Beteiligt am Reichtum sind laut Marx die Arbeiter nur insoweit, wie die Benutzung ihrer Arbeitskraft ihre Entlohnung notwendig macht.

Karl Marx (1818 -1883) war ein deutscher Philosoph, Ökonom, Gesellschaftstheoretiker, politischer Journalist, Protagonist der Arbeiterbewegung sowie Kritiker der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft und der Religion. Zusammen mit Friedrich Engels wurde er zum einflussreichsten Theoretiker des Sozialismus und Kommunismus. Bis heute werden seine Theorien kontrovers diskutiert.

But First You Need to Realize — YOU ARE THE BRAND.
It’s no secret that more people than ever before are building thriving businesses around their personal brands. But why do some create six- or even seven-figure businesses while so many others strive to make a consistent income?

Much of the personal brand space plays out in two ways. The first group of people sells a false version of themselves, thinking that image or perception alone will get them the results they seek. These folks don’t realize that attention isn’t owed, it’s earned.

The flip side of presenting a false version of yourself is oversharing in the name of authenticity. They talk nonstop about their issues, sometimes revealing way more than what is even comfortable to read about. It’s as if these people are trying to sell their struggles, and it doesn’t work in the long run. Like a car wreck, these folks garner attention, but it’s short-lived.

Here’s a simple question that can serve as a litmus test for you: “Can I build a campfire around what I’m sharing?” Is there warmth? Are you building something that is attractive and inviting to others? Can you build a community around it? Are you someone whom others want to invite onto their stages, in front of their employees, or into their lives? 

In You Are the Brand, Mike Kim shares his proven 8-step blueprint that has helped build the brands for some of today’s most influential thought leaders — as well as his own personal brand. In this practical and inspiring book, you will learn:
How to identify and showcase your unique expertise
How to gain clarity on your message, market, and business model
Why the most effective marketing strategy is to simply tell the truth

It charts Tennyson Reach’s gestation in 2005, when the Queensland government announced the construction of a brand new State Tennis Centre and six building strong luxury apartment complex on the site of the former Tennyson Powerhouse, the 2007 release of off-the-plan Tennyson Reach apartment sale contracts, the 2009 property value “reality check” spawned by the Global Financial Crisis, and finally the raw devastation wrought by the infamous 2011 Brisbane River flooding. So named because this book analyses the breached contracts (through extensive case noting of the published Supreme Court cases involving failures to settle Tennyson Reach apartment purchases), the breached banks of the Brisbane River and finally the breached property value and lifestyle dreams of those who spent substantial sums for views of the Brisbane River that ultimately proved to be far too close for comfort, Tennyson Breach concludes with critiques of the ways in which the Brisbane City Council, before and after January 2011, managed both the Tennyson Reach development application and the post flood future of the Tennyson Reach site."

Nevertheless, if one were forced to name the founder of the classical liberal perspective in political thought which holds as its primary political principle that individual liberty is to be respected and protected one would have to point to the English philosopher John Locke. 

This short book offers a sympathetic account of the key contentions and arguments that add up to Locke's classical liberal political philosophy. Not every claim Locke makes within political philosophy fits comfortably within the classical liberal paradigm. Nor was every policy stance Locke took consistent with the abstract principles of his political doctrine. Nevertheless, the picture found in this book of Locke as the fountainhead of classical liberal political thinking both captures the essence of Locke as a normative political theorist and reveals a good deal of the character and plausibility of the classical liberal vision."

Over the past decade, Snakes in Suits has become the definitive book on how to discover and defend yourself against psychopaths in the office. Now, Dr. Paul Babiak and Dr. Robert D. Hare return with a revised and updated edition of their essential guide.

All of us at some point have—or will—come into contact with psychopathic individuals. The danger they present may not be readily apparent because of their ability to charm, deceive, and manipulate. Although not necessarily criminal, their self-serving nature frequently is destructive to the organizations that employ them. So how can we protect ourselves and our organizations in a business climate that offers the perfect conditions for psychopaths to thrive?

In Snakes in Suits, Hare, an expert on the scientific study of psychopathy, and Babiak, an industrial and organizational psychologist and a leading authority on the corporate psychopath, examine the role of psychopaths in modern corporations and provide the tools employers can use to avoid and deal with them. Together, they have developed the B-Scan 360, a research tool designed specifically for business professionals.

Dr. Babiak and Dr. Hare reveal the secret lives of psychopaths, explain the ways in which they manipulate and deceive, and help you to see through their games. The rapid pace of today’s corporate environment provides the perfect breeding ground for these ""snakes in suits"" and this newly revised and updated classic gives you the insight, information, and power to protect yourself and your company before it’s too late."

“Every sales manager should read The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is a book to keep at the bedside, or on the living room table—a book to dip into as needed, to browse in now and then, to enjoy in small stimulating portions. It is a book for the hours and for the years, a book to turn to over and over again, as to a friend, a book of moral, spiritual and ethical guidance, an unfailing source of comfort and inspiration.”—Lester J. Bradshaw, Jr., Former Dean, Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective Speaking & Human Relations

“I have read almost every book that has ever been written on salesmanship, but I think Og Mandino has captured all of them in The Greatest Salesman in the World. No one who follows these principles will ever fail as a salesman, and no one will ever be truly great without them; but, the author has done more than present the principles—he has woven them into the fabric of one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read.”—Paul J. Meyer, President of Success Motivation Institute, Inc.

“I was overwhelmed by The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is, without doubt, the greatest and the most touching story I have ever read.

A riveting study of the intersections between Jewish and Latin American culture, this immigrant family memoir recounts history with psychological insight and the immediacy of a thriller.
  
 In Nuestra América, eminent anthropologist and historian Claudio Lomnitz traces his grandparents’ exile from Eastern Europe to South America. At the same time, the book is a pretext to explain and analyze the worldview, culture, and spirit of countries such as Peru, Colombia, and Chile, from the perspective of educated Jewish emigrants imbued with the hope and determination typical of those who escaped Europe in the 1920s.
  
 Lomnitz’s grandparents, who were both trained to defy ghetto life with the pioneering spirit of the early Zionist movement, became intensely involved in the Peruvian leftist intellectual milieu and its practice of connecting Peru’s indigenous past to an emancipatory internationalism that included Jewish culture and thought. After being thrown into prison supposedly for their socialist leanings, Lomnitz’s grandparents were exiled to Colombia, where they were subject to its scandals, its class system, its political life. Through this lens, Lomnitz explores the almost negligible attention and esteem that South America holds in US public opinion. The story then continues to Chile during World War II, Israel in the 1950s, and finally to Claudio’s youth, living with his parents in Berkeley, California, and Mexico City."

You may try to cover up by doing a more difficult trick and fail again. The way out of this dilemma, however, is not immediate, but it is reliable: a surer mastery of technique. This means the proper instruction book, and practice.
In this definitive work on card technique, step-by-step instructions teach you the correct methods for the basic manipulations and the more advanced flourishes, and only then allow you to learn tricks. Offering the most foolproof methods available, Jean Hugard and Fredrick Braue explain such basic manipulations as the palm, the shuffle, the lift, the side slip, the pass, the glimpse, the jog, and the reverse. They detail various false deals, crimps, and changes and the more advanced execution needed for forces, fans, and the use of the prearranged deck. Also presented is a wide variety of tricks, including discoveries, self-working tricks, one-handed tricks, stranger cards, and such individually famous tricks as the four aces, the rising cards, and the Zingone spread. In addition, the authors include a complete compendium of shakedown sleights — to warn the card player and aid the entertainer — and a performer's guide to misdirection and patter.
Many of the methods explained were revealed here for the first time, while many previously known tricks are presented in improved versions. In every case the aim is simplicity of technique for the purpose of mystifying an audience, not technique for the sake of technique. An unsurpassed collection of methods and manipulations, this classic work will help any aspiring magician to achieve expert card technique."

But what appears today as a charming and exquisite landscape painting, was actually one of the first avant-garde movements whose members had decided to fight the values of traditional art. The impressionist outdoor paintings shocked the public by the technique used, but also by their apparent banality. As Monet, Sisley, Pissarro and many others sought to capture the ephemeral nature of light, the next generation would reject naturalism. Indeed, post-impressionists such as Gauguin, Van Gogh, Cézanne and Seurat favored the subjective rather than the objective and the eternal rather than the concrete. In doing so, they laid the formal foundations of 20th-century modern art. This book is a visual guide through the crucial moments in the history of art and the progression of the 19th-century to modernity."

Peter Freestone was Freddie Mercury’s Personal Assistant for the last 12 years of his life. He lived with Mercury in London, Munich and New York, and he was with him when he died.

In this book, the most intimate account of Mercury’s life ever written, he reveals the truth behind the scandalous rumours, the outrageous lifestyle and Mercury’s relationships with men, women and the other members of Queen.

From the famous names – including Elton John, Kenny Everett, Elizabeth Taylor and Rod Stewart – to the shadowy army of lovers, fixers and hangers-on, Peter Freestone saw them all play their part in the tragi-comedy that was Freddie Mercury’s life.

Freestone lived with Mercury in Europe and America for over a decade. From the East 50s apartment in New York to Kensington Lodge, the house in London where Mercury died – not to mention innumerable international hotel rooms and apartments in between –  Freestone was always on hand to serve and protect the man he had first met in the Biba department store in the early 1970s. Then Queen was a largely unknown band. Soon it would be the most glitzy of glam rock bands. Freestone saw the fame arrive and with it the generosity, the excess, and the celebrity friends who came and went.

“I was chief cook and bottle washer, waiter, butler, valet, secretary, amanuensis, cleaner, baby-sitter… and agony aunt,” he writes. “I shopped for him both at supermarkets and art markets, I travelled the world with him, I was with him at the highs and came through the lows with him. I saw the creative juices flow and I also saw the frustration when life wasn’t going well. I acted as his bodyguard when needed and in the end, of course, I was one of his nurses.”

Freestone’s bet-selling account of a talented and extravagant star’s life and death is compelling, entertaining and ultimately, very touching.

Illustrated with many photos from personal and Freestone’s own archives.

Press Reviews:

“An entertaining and thought provoking read” – PRS for Music Sales

“This collection of Freddie’s own words is the closest thing there is to an autobiography of a man with no regrets. The foreword is written by his mother” – reFRESH magazine, Leading Gay mag in the UK"

The day before yesterday my dear friend Weber, among other things, wrote to me that the day after the Elector’s arrival it was publicly announced that he was to take up his residence in Munich, which came like a thunder-clap on Mannheim, wholly, so to say, extinguishing the universal illumination by which the inhabitants had testified their joy on the previous day.  The fact was also communicated to all the court musicians, with the addition that each was at liberty to follow the court to Munich or to remain in Mannheim, (retaining the same salaries,) and in a fortnight each was to give a written and sealed decision to the Intendant.  Weber, who is, as you know, in the most miserable circumstances, wrote as follows:— “I anxiously desire to follow my gracious master to Munich, but my decayed circumstances prevent my doing so”. Before this occurred there was a grand court concert, where poor Madlle.  Weber felt the fangs of her enemies; for on this occasion she did not sing!  It is not known who was the cause of this."

Best Drawing Book Ever! ★★★★★
by FineArtFan - Jan 22, 2021

This book is a treasure! It’s all about drawing portraits from life, but not the kind of portraits you find in a portrait gallery. These are portraits of regular people out in the world, in cafes, on subways, in parks. The artist/author, Nevin Berger, has done each drawing on an iPad and has recorded the process one pencil stroke at a time. On each page of the book, the drawing creation process plays back quickly so that you can see exactly how the drawing was done, mark by mark, erasure by erasure. It’s a fascinating process to see it all unfold and tremendously instructive to anyone who wants to learn to draw from life, or is just interested in how art creation happens. But the whole thing works because the drawings are so good! Watching Mr. Berger draw, one feels that one is learning from a master. And it’s great that the process is sped up; in just a matter of a few minutes the blank page becomes inhabited by a compelling personality. Mr. Berger adds helpful drawing tips with each portrait, as well as describing the circumstances under which the drawing was created. All and al, this book is an informative and entertaining experience!"

Time and money are at stake for parents, but reputation is also at risk for students and studios. With no regulation, this third-party industry leaves you asking yourself the same question after every competition: Is it worth it?

For Chasta Hamilton, six years of sending dancers to competition was six years too many. She swore off competitive dance and rewrote her curriculum to focus on the whole person within each dancer. In Trash the Trophies, Chasta shows you how she challenged preconceived notions of success in the dance industry and embraced camaraderie, effective leadership, and philanthropic initiative to transform her studio. With the four pillars of her intensive training program—technique, performance, community, and character—you'll learn how to increase ROI for everyone involved.

Dance is a commitment to principles; an art form beyond rankings and judgment. This book will show you how to put meaning back into movement, and joy back into the dance studio."

The latest in the series features 12 new male and female art models—as well as Becca from the previous book—in a collection of poses selected by readers and visitors to the authors' website. The contrast has also been increased in many of the photos to provide deeper, more challenging shadows. While the guide includes individuals and couples with a wide range of body types in natural, relaxed stances as well as some inspired by classical works of art, the primary focus is on dynamic poses—twisting, scrunching, reaching, and even fighting. Poses are precisely lit, revealing every area of the model, and have been carefully chosen to illustrate important effects such as foreshortening and perspective changes. A judicious amount of photo retouching is done, not to make the models more glamorous or plastic, but to remove distractions that detract from the essence of the models."

This account of such indulgence, a mosaic of short episodes, is the platform for presenting the History of Art, Literature and especially Film as it was encountered, using hyperlinks for reference and illustration. A series of five books presents the whole rose tinted reminiscence beginning with the first book in Bournemouth-by-the-Sea, all that time ago, when Modern Art was, indeed, still relatively modern.
The many references to Literature and History, throughout the books, reflect what the Fine Arts once enjoyed. This was a happy synthesis between Art, History and Literature. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Fine Arts were deprived of this by other Art forms, which included Illustration, Photography, and particularly Film. The consequence of these developments was an ideology of what little remained. This was called Modern Art.
Book Two describes the first year on the Diploma Course at Wimbledon and the new experience of living away from home. The first term included: visiting the Courtauld, the galleries in Bond Street, insulting David Hockney, a Private View at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, the Hayward, and going to the many Art-House cinemas up in town. Giles also wandered around the museums and explored the historical parts of London, each with its own story.
As well as experimenting with painting and learning to stretch canvas Giles began taking photographs. A distinct smell of oil paint still hung in the air but the ethos was noticeably beginning to change. They attended a dynamic Buckminster Fuller lecture and as summer approached began to plan travelling to the great galleries in Italy, popping over to the Parthenon as a preliminary."

In terms of excitement, however, civilian life couldn't compete – especially when the only real demand for helicopter pilots was as glorified chauffeurs for the very wealthy.



Jerry had a passion for the movies and spotted a way in to a new career. Somebody had to fly those crazy acrobatic stunts and capture dramatic aerial footage, and he reckoned he could do it better, push his helicopter further, and guarantee the most exciting shots, which other pilots might have considered impossible. And he was right.



Over the past 35 years Jerry has become the go-to man for aerial filmmaking, shooting everything from music videos, car commercials and nature documentaries to the Athens Olympic Games and the landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis. But it is in Hollywood that Jerry has really made his mark. He was barely out of his 20s when he worked on the airborne finale to the James Bond film A View to a Kill, and that helped cement his reputation for the decades since.



Film Pilot: Flying the Lens is full of entertaining behind-the-scenes stories (some that almost ended in disaster for Jerry and an A-list actor or two…) and revelatory insights into just how this invisible sector of the film business operates. We all take aerial footage for granted, without appreciating the lengths gone to shoot it. This is perhaps never more apparent than when Jerry's skills are called upon to gather more important footage – the burning oilfields of Kuwait following the first Gulf War, and flooded New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina."

The microlithic abstract art figurative language that's incorporated into the Mammoth People's heat treated flint prismatic flake knives and their potsherds is the latchkey that provides a window into the distant past Ice Age. It reveals the epic folklore tales that the Mammoth People conveyed to their children. The interpretations of over seventeen hundred of these microlithic abstract artwork eating utensils culminated to give their complete popular folklore tales. These stories describe their or their ancestors epic journey to the center of the North American continent from a faraway volcanic homeland. They involved a violently erupting volcano, lahars, falling through the predator ice, attacks by lurking saber-toothed cats and lions, and being raided by the Palomino Pony People warrior braves as they trekked across the plains of the North American continent in their long Mammoth People mammoth caravan. The verification of everything implied in the book is in the interpretations, a few of which are given in the book along with photos of the artwork that's being interpreted.

We are pleased to offer excerpts from three of the most popular chess books available today. They are The ChessCafe Puzzle Books 1 and 2 by German grandmaster Karsten Müller and Book 3, also  by Müller, and in cooperation with Dutch international master Merijn van Delft.


All three books are available in both traditional, hard copy and electronic editions. The original books are published in figurine algebraic notation, with Informant-style evaluation symbols. For this Puzzle Sampler, we have converted the notation to simple English algebraic and replaced the Informant-style evaluation symbols with text.


The ChessCafe Puzzle Book 1 combines clear discussions of tactical themes with over 600 well-chosen positions to test, challenge and teach. Although the classic combinations are not ignored, the great emphasis is on positions from modern tournament practice of the last decade.


From CCPB1, four puzzles with different tactical themes (please note that the actual numbering of the puzzles has been changed for this Kindle edition). It is Black to move in Puzzles 1 and 2, White to move and Puzzles 3 and 4. Solutions are immediately after the four puzzles.


The ChessCafe Puzzle Book 2 takes on the more difficult and less tangible aspect of positional play. As most chess instructors and players know, it is much more difficult to teach and learn strategic concepts than tactics. The author not only presents puzzles to solve, but also presents examples of different strategic ideas. Here is an excerpt from the section about Outposts.


One of the most important skills a chessplayer needs is the ability to defend a position that is under siege. In the third volume in the highly acclaimed, best-selling ChessCafe Puzzle Book series, international grandmaster Karsten Müller, along with international master Merijn van Delft, examines and expounds upon the vital defensive concepts and techniques used to repulse enemy attacks.


From CCPB3, three puzzles with different themes (please note that the actual numbering of the puzzles has been changed for this Kindle edition). It is Black to move in all three puzzles. Solutions are immediately after the three puzzles."

“Sean Howe’s history of Marvel makes a compulsively readable, riotous and heartbreaking version of my favorite story, that of how a bunch of weirdoes changed the world…That it’s all true is just frosting on the cake.”  —Jonathan Lethem

For the first time, Marvel Comics tells the stories of the men who made Marvel: Martin Goodman, the self-made publisher who forayed into comics after a get-rich-quick tip in 1939, Stan Lee, the energetic editor who would shepherd the company through thick and thin for decades and Jack Kirby, the WWII veteran who would co-create Captain America in 1940 and, twenty years later, developed with Lee the bulk of the company’s marquee characters in a three-year frenzy. Incorporating more than one hundred original interviews with those who worked behind the scenes at Marvel over a seventy-year-span, Marvel Comics packs anecdotes and analysis into a gripping narrative of how a small group of people on the cusp of failure created one of the most enduring pop cultural forces in contemporary America."

The great thing about this process is that you don’t even need a website or any money to get started because we are going to be using some wicked free tools to set this up.


The incentive for the sites you work with is to be able to offer their readers a really special and unique product for nothing.


With a bit of luck (and some help from you) they will send it out to their mailing lists, post a link on their social media pages and do all manner of other things to spread your freebie around.


At the end of this lesson you’ll be able to send a pitch email like this…


“Hey I’d like to set up a special promotion to offer 200 of your readers a free copy of my latest album package (usually it goes for $25)… is that cool?”


…pretty tempting right!


But that’s not even the best bit…


… because all those new hits will go over to Facebook where you will ask people to “Like” your page in return for the freebie. 


You can now keep on entertaining them long into the future and posting the odd link to something they can buy.

It is not surprising that people who could come out on top in a military battle, or war, could also come out on top in a poker game.
Both involve competing in fields of constantly changing uncertainty in which your opponents can lie, deceive and cheat.
Both involve intense mental concentration and endurance for several hours or more at a time; constantly calculating probabilities about uncertainties; reading your opponents; deceiving your opponents; and, always knowing that your opponents could be deceiving and even cheating you.

WINNING GAMBLERS

To be a winning gambler you need to know 4 things.

1: When you are being
deceived or cheated.
2: When the odds
are in your favour.
3: Money management.
4: Yourself.

Or, alternatively, only gamble against people who you do win against – people worse than you."

In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method.

The book’s progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure’s shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure’s silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure’s volume and mass. Examples, step-by-steps, and special “tips” offer helpful hints and practical guidance throughout.

Lavishly illustrated with the author’s stunning artwork, The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing combines solid instruction with thoughtful meditations on the art of drawing, to both instruct and inspire artists of all levels."

The exercises and work in this book have enhanced my acting tremendously, given me a way of working that is unmatched by any other acting book I've ever come accross (and I've read a ton of em) and has made me a powerful teacher and director in my own right.  It explains Eric's Technique of Freeing the Instrument (Explained in great detail in his No Acting Please which should be read prior to this book.) It explains a new way of looking at material and personally connecting it to the actor through choices and choice approaches. It truly helps make the actor an artist in that he creates and is truly using himself.

In 1931, Ninette de Valois started a ballet company with just six dancers. Within twenty years, The Royal Ballet - as it became - was established as one of the world's great companies. It has produced celebrated dancers, from Margot Fonteyn to Darcey Bussell, and one of the richest repertoires in ballet.

The company danced through the Blitz, won an international reputation in a single New York performance and added to the glamour of London's Swinging Sixties. It has established a distinctive English school of ballet, a pure classical style that could do justice to the 19th-century repertory and to new British classics.

Leading dance critic, Zoë Anderson, vividly portrays the extraordinary personalities who created the company and the dancers who made such an impact on their audiences. She looks at the bad times as well as the good, examining the controversial directorships of Norman Morrice and Ross Stretton and the criticism fired at the company as the Royal Opera House closed for redevelopment."

For years, galleries have acted as gatekeeper separating artists and collectors. But with the explosion of the Internet, a new generation of savvy, independent artists is connecting with buyers and making a substantial living doing what they love.

How to Sell Your Art Online shows any artist how to make a successful living from their work. Cory Huff dispels the myth of the starving artist and provides the effective business strategies necessary to make artistic creations pay. He helps individual artists find their niche; outlines the elements essential for an effective website; and provides invaluable advice on e-mail marketing, blogging, social media marketing, and paid advertising—explaining how to tie all these online activities into offline success.

Most importantly, he shares the secret to overcoming the biggest challenge artists face when self-marketing: learning how to tell their unique stories. Every artist has a reason for making art, but can’t always find the right way to express it. Huff provides exercises artists can use to clarify the intellectual and emotional process behind their art, and teaches them how turn that knowledge into stories they can tell online and in person—and expand their reach through blogs and social media to build their art business.

Drawing from the stories of successful artists, thoroughly describing how art is sold today, and providing tips on how to build connections personally and electronically, How to Sell Your Art Online illustrates the countless ways artists can take control of their creative careers—and sell their work without selling out."

____________

HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK MENTALITY IMPACTS YOUR GAME?

About 30% of your impact on the game is marked by your mentality and emotional control. Countless players lose League of Legends games, not because of a lack of mechanics or gameplay skills, but because of poor emotional management in difficult times.

In this book, you will learn:
How to channel your motivation.
The weight of attitude in a game.
Understanding the numbers and statistics behind bad luck
What is variance and how it can affect us.
How to fight bad luck.
The importance of decisions.
How to differentiate between chance and causality.
The independence of decisions and of each game
Understanding the role of emotions in League of Legends
Types of emotions (Pride, anger, fear...)
Attitude during defeat
Is it good to be greedy in League of Legends?
Emotional Reactions
The 4 emotional levels of defeat
Dealing with a rough patch
Consequences of bad spells
How to deal with a losing streak
How to fight tilt
Positive tilt or overconfidence
Moving up in division
Identifying types of tilt and take advantage of the opponent
     

I think there is a great lack of training in terms of mindset. There's a lot of theory about how best to play League of Legends: macro-game (or strategy) and micro-game (or tactics). However, you have to keep in mind that League of Legends is a cooperative game, and as such, we don't play against machines but against other people, and at certain times, we don't apply logic, but rather let ourselves be driven by emotions such as anger, rage, or frustration.

Are you aware of what you feel while playing?
Do you know that your emotions are a consequence of your thoughts, and these are a product of the training of your mentality?
Do you prepare yourself before, during and after to avoid going into tilt?
Do you feel that you really have better mechanical skills than the players in your division but you can't get out of it?

I am Manuel Martín, Civil Engineer from the University of Granada. My hobbies are computing and everything related to technology, as well as science and psychology. I have been playing League of Legends since 2014.

I look forward to helping you with my work."

For five short years women in American cinema were modern!  They took lovers, had babies out of wedlock, got rid of cheating husbands, enjoyed their sexuality, led unapologetic careers and, in general, acted the way many think women only acted after 1968. 

Before then, women on screen had come in two varieties - good or bad - sweet ingenue or vamp.  Then two stars came along to blast away these common stereotypes.  Garbo turned the femme fatale into a woman whose capacity for love and sacrifice made all other human emotions seem pale.  Meanwhile, Norma Shearer succeeded in taking the ingenue to a place she'd never been: the bedroom.  Garbo and Shearer took the stereotypes and made them complicated.

In the wake of these complicated women came others, a deluge of indelible stars - Constance Bennett, Ruth Chatterton, Mae Clarke, Claudette Colbert, Marlene Dietrich, Kay Francis, Ann Harding, Jean Harlow, Miriam Hopkins, Dorothy Mackaill, Barbara Stanywyck, Mae West and Loretta Young all came into their own during the pre-Code era.  These women pushed the limits and shaped their images along modern lines.

Then, in July 1934, the draconian Production Code became the law in Hollywood and these modern women of the screen were banished, not to be seen again until the code was repealed three decades later.  

Mick LaSalle, film critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, takes readers on a tour of pre-Code films and reveals how this was the true golden age of women's films and how the movies of the pre-Code are still worth watching.  The bold, pioneering and complicated women of the pre-Code era are about to take their place in the pantheon of film history, and America is about to reclaim a rich legacy."

But when the noted film critic does pan a movie, the result is a humorous, scathing critique far more entertaining than the movie itself.

I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie is a collection of more than 200 of Ebert's most biting and entertaining reviews of films receiving a mere star or less from the only film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize. Ebert has no patience for these atrocious movies and minces no words in skewering the offenders.

Witness: Armageddon * (1998) --The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out.

The Beverly Hillbillies* (1993)--Imagine the dumbest half-hour sitcom you've ever seen, spin it out to ninety-three minutes by making it even more thin and shallow, and you have this movie. It's appalling.

North no stars (1994)--I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.

Police Academy no stars (1984)--It's so bad, maybe you should pool your money and draw straws and send one of the guys off to rent it so that in the future, whenever you think you're sitting through a bad comedy, he could shake his head, chuckle tolerantly, and explain that you don't know what bad is.

Dear God * (1996)--Dear God is the kind of movie where you walk out repeating the title, but not with a smile.

The movies reviewed within I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie are motion pictures you'll want to distance yourself from, but Roger Ebert's creative and comical musings on those films make for a book no movie fan should miss."

During van Meegeren's heyday as a forger of Vermeers, he earned the equivalent of fifty million dollars, the acclaim of the world's press, and the satisfaction of swindling Hermann Göring himself, trading the Nazi commander one of his forgeries in exchange for the return of hundreds of looted Dutch paintings. But he was undone by his very success, thriving so noticeably during World War II that when it ended, he was arrested as a Nazi collaborator. His only defense was to admit that he himself had painted the Old Masters that had passed through his hands-a confession the public refused to believe, until, in a huge media event, the courts staged the public painting of what would be van Meegeren's last ""Vermeer.""

I Was Vermeer is a gripping real-life mystery that exposes the life and techniques of the consummate art forger; the fascinating work of the experts who try to track down the fakes; and the collusion and ego in the art establishment that, even today, allow forgery to thrive. Wry, amoral, and plotted like a thriller, it is the first major book in forty years on this astonishing episode in history.

Frank Wynne is a writer and award-winning literary translator. Born in Ireland, he has lived and worked in Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, London, and Buenos Aires, and currently lives in San José, Costa Rica. He has translated more than a dozen novels, among them the works of Michel Houellebecq, Frédéric Beigbeder, Pierre Mérot, and Ahmadou Kourouma. A journalist and broadcaster, he has written for the Sunday Times, the Independent, the Irish Times, Melody Maker, and Time Out."

The jewelled island of Capri was their playground. Florence was famous for leather-goods and gold, and it didn’t hurt Florentine fortunes that Pucci and Ferragamo were Jetset must haves. In the 1970’s fashion heralded the arrival of ready-to-wear and the demand for practical masculine styled clothing that women could wear to work and Milan rose to power as Italy’s fashion epic-enter.


In the last century, Italian movies, which have had a great influence on Hollywood, showed what sensual style meant to Italians through famous images of Sophia Loren and later, Monica Belluci in movies like Malena. The look was well tailored, respectable, and sensual at the same time. To these iconic images have been added the style statements of the likes of Prada, Pucci, Missoni, Versace and Valentino, who have taken Italian style in an entirely different, over-the-top direction.


Here we present the lives and legends of the Dynasties of Italian Fashion:

• Armani

• Missoni

• Prada

• Pucci

• Versace

• Valentino

Do cities need skyscrapers? Are there cities without density or are there dense settlements without being a city? Some cities are liveable for the majority, others just for a few. As we enter the first urban century, we start to realise that today‘s cities are not sustainable, no matter from which side we look at them. Prerequisites for their transformation towards liveability, sustainability and resilience are better knowledge and ability to change. Understanding the city and knowledge about the city should be the base for change. As we begin to realise that cities are not neutral objects, but that people define the city, the mobile citizen gains a central role in the definition of the future city."

This book in the series will help artists become proficient in incorporating chiaroscuro or light and dark lighting—a technique used by the great masters to produce drama and depth in their paintings—to define the human form. The book incorporates a new layout featuring two primary views per pose as well as close-up faces. With the book, artists can study 95 poses in strong unidirectional lighting and observe the female form through more than 200 photos. Varieties of body types—ranging from thin to plus-size—and ethnicities are included. Poses have been carefully chosen to illustrate important effects such as foreshortening and perspective changes. With this guide, artists can achieve longer drawing sessions than they could when drawing from a model directly. A judicious amount of photo retouching is done—not to make the models more glamorous or plastic but to remove distractions that detract from the models’ essence. Each photo may be zoomed in on specific body parts to achieve a higher level of detail. 

This ebook does not have the full 360-degree views of every pose. If you would like all the views of all the poses, please see the Companion Disk or print book with disk."

It was first presented on stage to the public in 1913.

Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador's garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women's independence."

Reggae ist dort echte „Volksmusik“, die die Erlebnisse, Wün- sche und Ansichten einer quirlig-chaotischen Gesellschaft reflektiert. Hauptvertreter des Reggae war Bob Marley (1945–1981), der in den 1970ern zu einer Kultfigur wurde. Wynands’ Buch zeichnet die Geschichte der Reggae-Musik bis in unsere Tage nach und stellt dabei den Mythos Bob Marley in seinen musikgeschichtlichen Kontext. Der Autor gibt einen tiefen Einblick in Herkunft, Entwicklung und in Spielweisen einer faszinierenden Musik, deren innovative Kraft die euro-amerikanische Popmusik seit 35 Jahren entscheidend prägt und verändert.


(Das Buch wurde 1995 veröffentlicht. Daher schildert es die Entwicklung des Reggae auch nur bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt.)"

Bauhaus Women: A Global Perspective reclaims the other half of Bauhaus history, yielding a new understanding of the radical experiments in art and life undertaken at the Bauhaus and the innovations that continue to resonate with viewers around the world today.



The story of the Bauhaus has usually been kept narrow, localized to its original time and place and associated with only a few famous men such as Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and László Moholy-Nagy.



Bauhaus Women: A Global Perspective bursts the bounds of this slim history by revealing fresh Bauhaus faces: Forty-five Bauhaus women unjustifiably forgotten by most history books. This book also widens the lens to reveal how the Bauhaus drew women from many parts of Europe and beyond, and how, through these cosmopolitan female designers, artists, and architects, it sent the Bauhaus message out into the world and to a global audience."

The fear that we’re not good enough or that we don’t know enough results in untold numbers of creative crises and potential masterpieces that never get realized.


Electronic musicians used to be able to hide behind clunky, emerging technology as an excuse for inaction. But musicians today live in a golden age of tools and technology. A ninety-nine-cent smartphone app can give you the functionality of a million-dollar recording studio. A new song can be shared with the world as soon as it’s finished. Tutorials for every sound design or music production technique can be found through a Google search. All of these developments have served to level the playing field for musicians, making it possible for a bedroom producer to create music at a level that used to be possible only for major-label artists.


But despite all of this, making music is still hard. Why?


Making Music was written both to answer this question and to offer ways to make it easier. It presents a systematic, concrete set of patterns that you can use when making music in order to move forward. It will teach you how to make music using technology, with a specific emphasis on solving musical problems, making progress, and (most importantly) finishing what you start."

–Larry Moss, from the Introduction

When Oscar-winning actors Helen Hunt and Hilary Swank accepted their Academy Awards, each credited Larry Moss’s guidance as key to their career-making performances. There is a two-year waiting list for his advanced acting classes.  But now everyone–professionals and amateurs alike–can discover Moss’s passionate, in-depth teaching.

Inviting you to join him in the classroom and onstage, Moss shares the techniques he has developed over thirty years to help actors set their emotions, imagination, and behavior on fire, showing how the hard work of preparation pays off in performances that are spontaneous, fresh, and authentic.  

From the foundations of script analysis to the nuances of physicalization and sensory work, here are the case studies, exercises, and insights that enable you to connect personally with a script, develop your character from the inside out, overcome fear and inhibition, and master the technical skills required for success in the theater, television, and movies.

Far more than a handbook, The Intent to Live is the personal credo of a master teacher. Moss’s respect for actors and love of the actor’s craft enliven every page, together with examples from a wealth of plays and films, both current and classic, and vivid appreciations of great performances. Whether you act for a living or simply want a deeper understanding of acting greatness, The Intent to Live will move, instruct, and inspire you."

Ballet is among the most beautiful forms of expression ever devised: an exquisite mix of sight and sound, stunning, aesthetics, and awesome technique.

Ballet For Dummies is for anyone who wants to enjoy all that the dance forms offers – as an onlooker who wants to get a leg up on the forms you're likely to see or as an exercise enthusiast who understands that the practice of ballet can help you gain: 
 More strength Greater flexibility Better body alignment Confidence in movement Comfort through stress reduction Infinite grace – for life   
From covering the basics of classical ballet to sharing safe and sensible ways to try your hand (and toes) at moving through the actual dance steps, this expert reference shows you how to: 
 Build your appreciation for ballet from the ground up. Choose the best practice space and equipment. Warm up to your leap into the movements. Locate musical options for each exercise. Look for certain lifts in a stage performance. Tell a story with gestures. Picture a day in the life of a professional ballet dancer. Identify best-loved classic and contemporary ballets. Speak the language of ballet.  
Today you can find a ballet company in almost every major city on earth. Many companies have their own ballet schools – some for training future professionals, and others for interested amateurs. As you fine-tune your classical ballet technique – or even if you just like to read about it – you'll become better equipped to fully appreciate the great choreography and many styles of the dance. Ballet For Dummies raises the curtain on a world of beauty, grace, poise, and possibility!
 
P.S. If you think this book seems familiar, you're probably right. The Dummies team updated the cover and design to give the book a fresh feel, but the content is the same as the previous release of Ballet For Dummies (9780764525681). The book you see here shouldn't be considered a new or updated product. But if you're in the mood to learn something new, check out some of our other books. We're always writing about new topics!"

Drawing on her personal experience, the author describes in fascinating detail the contributions made by a range of actors and institutions to these recent developments. The book focuses on the development of auction houses into globalised, often cutthroat 'art business' firms; the emergence and modi operandi of 'mega-dealers' and middlemen; the 'new frontier' of selling art on the internet; the radical changes in the profile of art collectors; the phenomenon of the 'branded' artist and the explosion of art fairs. It addresses the negative side to the art market's expansion, particularly its lack of transparency and light regulation. The author's engaging style makes this informative text ideal for collectors, students, and anyone interested in learning more about the evolution of the unprecedented market for art which exists today."

In the course of a Dungeons & Dragons game, a Dungeon Master has to make one decision after another in response to player behavior—and the better the players, the more unpredictable their behavior! It’s easy for even an experienced DM to get bogged down in on-the-spot decision-making or to let combat devolve into a boring slugfest, with enemies running directly at the player characters and biting, bashing, and slashing away.

In The Monsters Know What They’re Doing, Keith Ammann lightens the DM’s burden by helping you understand your monsters’ abilities and develop battle plans before your fifth edition D&D game session begins. Just as soldiers don’t whip out their field manuals for the first time when they’re already under fire, a DM shouldn’t wait until the PCs have just encountered a dozen bullywugs to figure out how they advance, fight, and retreat.

Easy to read and apply, The Monsters Know What They're Doing is essential reading for every DM."

She then staged a coup that ended with him being strangled with his own scarf in the halls of the palace, and herself crowned the Empress of Russia. Intelligent and determined, Catherine modeled herself off of her grandfather in-law, Peter the Great, and sought to further modernize and westernize Russia. She believed that the best way to do this was through a ravenous acquisition of art, which Catherine often used as a form of diplomacy with other powers throughout Europe. She was a self-proclaimed ""glutton for art"" and she would be responsible for the creation of the Hermitage, one of the largest museums in the world, second only to the Louvre. Catherine also spearheaded the further expansion of St. Petersburg, and the magnificent architectural wonder the city became is largely her doing. There are few women in history more fascinating than Catherine the Great, and for the first time, Susan Jaques brings her to life through the prism of art."

The real estate collapse, the economic downturn, burning out on 12-hour workdays — many people are rethinking their ideas about shelter — seeking an alternative to high rents, or a lifelong mortgage debt to a bank on an overpriced home. 


In this book are some 150 builders who have taken things into their own hands, creating tiny homes (under 500 sq. ft.). Homes on land, homes on wheels, homes on the road, homes on water, even homes in the trees. There are also studios, saunas, garden sheds, and greenhouses. 


There are 1,300 photos, showing a rich variety of small homemade shelters, and there are stories (and thoughts and inspirations) of the owner-builders who are on the forefront of this new trend in downsizing and self-sufficiency. 


Many people have decided to scale back, to get by with less stuff, to live in smaller homes. You can buy a ready-made tiny home, build your own, get a kit or prefab, or live in a bus, houseboat, or other movable shelter. Some cities have special ordinances for building “in-law” or “granny flats” in the backyard. There are innovative solutions in cities, such as the “capsules” in Tokyo. There are numerous blogs and websites with news, photos, and/or plans for tiny homes, documented here. 


If you’re thinking of scaling back, you’ll find plenty of inspiration here. Here’s a different approach, a 180° turn from increasing consumption. Here are builders, designers, architects (no less), dreamers, artists, road gypsies, and water dwellers who’ve achieved a measure of freedom and independence by taking shelter into their own hands.

It is one of Europe's greatest treasures and its own story is full of drama and surprise. 

Who commissioned the tapestry? Was it Bishop Odo, William's ruthless half-brother? Or Harold's dynamic sister Edith, juggling for a place in the new court? Hicks shows us this world and the miracle of the tapestry's making: the stitches, dyes and strange details in the margins. For centuries it lay ignored in Bayeux cathedral until its 'discovery' in the eighteenth century. It became a symbol of power as well as art: townsfolk saved it during the French Revolution; Napoleon displayed it to promote his own conquest; the Nazis strove to make it their own; and its influence endures today. 

This marvellous book, packed with thrilling stories, shows how we remake history in every age and how a great work of art has a life of its own."

 For the first time ever, the story of how these two young filmmakers struck lightning is being told by those who witnessed it. We Don’t Need Roads draws from over 500 hours of interviews, including original interviews with Zemeckis, Gale, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Huey Lewis, and over fifty others who contributed to one of the most popular and profitable film trilogies of all time. The book includes a 16-page color photo insert with behind-the-scenes pictures, concept art, and more. 

 With a focus not only on the movies, but also the lasting impact of the franchise and its fandom, We Don’t Need Roads is the ultimate read for anyone who has ever wanted to ride a Hoverboard, hang from the top of a clock tower, travel through the space-time continuum, or find out what really happened to Eric Stoltz after the first six weeks of filming. So, why don’t you make like a tree and get outta here—and start reading! We Don’t Need Roads is your density.
  
 “What fun! Deeply researched and engagingly written...the book Back to the Future fans have been craving for decades. Geekily enthusiastic and chock full of never-before-heard tales of what went on both on and off the screen, We Don't Need Roads is a book worthy of the beloved trilogy itself.”—Brian Jay Jones, author of the national bestseller Jim Henson: The Biography

“A very compelling and enjoyable history of our trilogy. For me, reading it was like going back in time. And—Great Scott—there were even a few anecdotes that I'd never heard!”—Bob Gale, co-creator, co-producer, and co-writer of the Back to the Future trilogy"

There are no gaps in the teaching process, no unnecessary reviews, just a seamless continuation of learning how to play the piano. 

Having introduced the C major, G7 and F major chords in Volume 1, you will now be able to play many more familiar songs using these three chords in the arrangements. This will make a very big difference in how and what you play. The songs will sound significantly fuller and more musical. 

New songs include Love Somebody; a cute song with a timely lyric, Money Can’t Buy Ev’rything; Beautiful Brown Eyes; Happy Birthday to You; Standing in the Need of Prayer; The Gift to be Simple; Alouette; Lavender’s Blue; Kum-Ba-Yah; London Bridge; Michael Row the Boat Ashore; and Rock It Away! Also included are many more enjoyable songs that may be less familiar to you but are a lot of fun to play. 

As far as expanding your musical skills, after playing in the C position in Volume 1, you will now be learning to play in the G and middle C positions. New chords include the G major, D7, and a new version of the C major chord. 

New music fundamentals and techniques introduced include sharps & flats, block & broken chords, how to use the damper pedal, how to play gradually louder and softer with the crescendo & diminuendo signs, the fermata sign, eighth notes, dotted quarter notes, and very short notes that include the staccato sign. With proper practice and observing Gayle Kowalchyk’s instructions, you will now be playing more smoothly and musically than ever before. 

What is very important for students of all ages is, however, your hands and fingers will probably become more flexible and stronger as you continue to play, making certain functions in your daily life somewhat easier. And you will be accomplishing all this while having a lot of fun."

Let Syd Field show you how.

“I based Like Water for Chocolate on what I learned in Syd's books. Before, I always felt structure imprisoned me, but what I learned was structure really freed me to focus on the story.”—Laura Esquivel

Technology is transforming the art and craft of screenwriting. How does the writer find new ways to tell a story with pictures, to create a truly outstanding film? Syd Field shows what works, why, and how in four extraordinary films: Thelma & Louise, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, The Silence of the Lambs, and Dances with Wolves.

Learn how:

Callie Khouri, in her first movie script, Thelma & Louise, rewrote the rules for good road movies and played against type to create a new American classic.
James Cameron, writer/director of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, created a sequel integrating spectacular special effects and a story line that transformed the Terminator, the quintessential killing machine, into a sympathetic character. This is how an action film is written.
Ted Tally adapted Thomas Harris's chilling 350-page novel, The Silence of the Lambs, into a riveting 120-page script—a lesson in the art and craft of adapting novels into film.
Michael Blake, author of Dances with Wolves, achieved every writer's dream as he translated his novel into an uncompromising film. Learn how he used transformation as a spiritual dynamic in this work of mythic sweep.

Informative and utterly engrossing, Four Screenplays belongs in every writer's library, next to Syn Field's highly acclaimed companion volumes, Screenplay, The Screenwriter's Workbook, and Selling a Screenplay.

“If I were writing screenplays . . . I would carry Syd Field around in my back pocket wherever I went.”—Steven Bochco, writer/producer/director, L.A. Law, Hill Street Blues"

It’s the first essential work of cultural history of the new decade."" —Charles Kaiser, The Guardian

The Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and New York Times–bestselling author of the behind-the-scenes explorations of the classic American Westerns High Noon and The Searchers now reveals the history of the controversial 1969 Oscar-winning film that signaled a dramatic shift in American popular culture.

Director John Schlesinger’s Darling was nominated for five Academy Awards, and introduced the world to the transcendently talented Julie Christie. Suddenly the toast of Hollywood, Schlesinger used his newfound clout to film an expensive, Panavision adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd. Expectations were huge, making the movie’s complete critical and commercial failure even more devastating, and Schlesinger suddenly found himself persona non grata in the Hollywood circles he had hoped to conquer.

Given his recent travails, Schlesinger’s next project seemed doubly daring, bordering on foolish. James Leo Herlihy’s novel Midnight Cowboy, about a Texas hustler trying to survive on the mean streets of 1960’s New York, was dark and transgressive. Perhaps something about the book’s unsparing portrait of cultural alienation resonated with him. His decision to film it began one of the unlikelier convergences in cinematic history, centered around a city that seemed, at first glance, as unwelcoming as Herlihy’s novel itself.

Glenn Frankel’s Shooting Midnight Cowboy tells the story of a modern classic that, by all accounts, should never have become one in the first place. The film’s boundary-pushing subject matter—homosexuality, prostitution, sexual assault—earned it an X rating when it first appeared in cinemas in 1969. For Midnight Cowboy, Schlesinger—who had never made a film in the United States—enlisted Jerome Hellman, a producer coming off his own recent flop and smarting from a failed marriage, and Waldo Salt, a formerly blacklisted screenwriter with a tortured past. The decision to shoot on location in New York, at a time when the city was approaching its gritty nadir, backfired when a sanitation strike filled Manhattan with garbage fires and fears of dysentery.

Much more than a history of Schlesinger’s film, Shooting Midnight Cowboy is an arresting glimpse into the world from which it emerged: a troubled city that nurtured the talents and ambitions of the pioneering Polish cinematographer Adam Holender and legendary casting director Marion Dougherty, who discovered both Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight and supported them for the roles of “Ratso” Rizzo and Joe Buck—leading to one of the most intensely moving joint performances ever to appear on screen. We follow Herlihy himself as he moves from the experimental confines of Black Mountain College to the theatres of Broadway, influenced by close relationships with Tennessee Williams and Anaïs Nin, and yet unable to find lasting literary success.

By turns madcap and serious, and enriched by interviews with Hoffman, Voight, and others, Shooting Midnight Cowboy: Art, Sex, Loneliness, Liberation, and the Making of a Dark Classic is not only the definitive account of the film that unleashed a new wave of innovation in American cinema, but also the story of a country—and an industry—beginning to break free from decades of cultural and sexual repression."

Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of ""unquenchable curiosity"" and ""feverishly inventive imagination"". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and ""his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote"". Marco Rosci points out, however, that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time."

How To Draw Animals For Kids: A Step-By-Step Drawing Book. Learn How To Draw 50 Animals Such As Dogs, Cats, Elephants And Many More! is the perfect book for your kids to help them improve their drawing skills.

Most kids have a magically undeniable connection with animals. There are young ones who imitate animal sounds even before they start talking. Some parents even have pets for their kids to grow up with to be their best pals and companions. Studies also show that having animals as a part of children's lives brings amazing benefits. It helps kids learn about empathy, compassion, and, of course, unconditional love.

This book is aimed towards kids that are animal-lovers who also enjoy drawing and making art. The book will help them become more steadily confident with using a pen in a controlled manner. Eye-hand coordination also plays an important role as well as concentration. While drawing from imagination has its own appeal, the learning effect is particularly high when there's a structure to follow and a goal in mind.

With this book, kids will acquire the ability to draw different animals and become more confident with using pen. Each finished animal represents a sense of achievement to keep them motivated. There are eight clear steps that would lead them to the goal, each of which can be easily followed by kindergarten kids. With each step, the animal takes on more and more shape until it can finally be clearly recognized. Simple forms, such as circles and triangles, serve as a basis for this.

A quick look at the most important facts of the book:

Your name is the tip of the spear. 

It's the first thing people see and hear. It's your first shot at grabbing people's attention and arousing their curiosity. How are people supposed to talk about your new company if they can't remember or pronounce the name? 


Contrary to popular belief, naming has nothing to do with omitting vowels. It has nothing to do with smashing letters together until you find an available URL that sounds like a Latvian powerlifter grunting. No, naming is a process. You'll need time. You'll need insight. You'll need to start on Page 1. 


Don't Call It That is not a book about naming. It is a step-by-step workbook that walks you through the ins and outs of the naming process. This book is your best defense against awful company names and the people who find them ""practical"" and ""functional."" A Hundred Monkeys Creative Director, Eli Altman, will help you develop attention grabbing names that speak to your audience and establish the seed of your brand.

The second edition of Don't Call It That is 40% bigger than the first. It has six new chapters, interviews with people who used the book to name their businesses, new name species, sixteen exercises and an expanded trademark section. 


The book is like that friend who isn't afraid to tell you what you need to hear. It'll help you understand what's at stake and how to approach naming creatively without neglecting practical realities like positioning, trademarks and URLs. 


How do you find a name that's available?

How do you find a name that grabs people's attention?

How do you tell the difference between a good name and a bad one?

How do you test names in the real world?

How do you find a name that elevates you above the competition? 


Don't Call It That will set you straight."

To the latter it speaks more in the temper of the studio discussion than in the spirit didactic. But, emboldened by the friendliness the profession always exhibits toward any serious word in art, the writer is moved to believe that the matters herein discussed may be found worthy of the artist's attention—perhaps of his question. For that reason the tone here and there is argumentative.

The question of balance has never been reduced to a theory or stated as a set of principles which could be sustained by anything more than example, which, as a working basis must require reconstruction with every change of subject. Other forms of construction have been sifted down in a search for the governing principle,—a substitution for the “rule and example.”

To the student and the amateur, therefore, it must be said this is not a “how-to-do” book. The number of these is legion, especially in painting, known to all students, wherein the matter is didactic and usually set forth with little or no argument. Such volumes are published because of the great demand and are demanded because the student, in his haste, will not stop for principles, and think it out. He will have a rule for each case; and when his direct question has been answered with a principle, he still inquires, “Well, what shall I do here?”

Why preach the golden rule of harmony as an abstraction, when inharmony is the concrete sin to be destroyed. We reach the former by elimination. Whatever commandments this book contains, therefore, are the shalt nots.

As the problems to the maker of pictures by photography are the same as those of the painter and the especial ambition of the former's art is to be painter-like, separations have been thought unnecessary in the address of the text. It is the best wish of the author that photography, following painting in her essential principles as she does, may prove herself a well met companion along art's highway,—seekers together, at arm's length, and in defined limits, of the same goal."

Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of ""unquenchable curiosity"" and ""feverishly inventive imagination"". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and ""his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote"". Marco Rosci points out, however, that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time."

If you like chess, odds are you can improve your game with checkmate problems.


If you are learning chess, or want to start learning chess, Top-Move Checkmates allow you to practice squeezing the maximum power out of small teams of your pawns and pieces. A great start!


Top-Move Checkmates allow you to solve problems where there is always exactly one best move (the top-move) every time it is your turn.


Top-Move Checkmates are presented to you in interactive diagrams. Think you know the answer? Just drag the piece to make the move you think is best. If your move is not the top-move, the interactive diagram gives you a hint.


These are checkmate problems, so you win every time. Ah, but how many hints did you need to win? The little voice inside us that says “I can DO this, and I don’t need hints!” keeps us coming back for more chess satisfaction.


All Top-Move problems are from actual games of chess. So if you do play chess games, you have confidence the problems are relevant to actual games.


But you don’t have to play games of chess: Plenty of people have plenty of fun with checkmate problems without ever playing chess games.


When you’re done with this book, please check out “16,236 Top-Move Checkmates” which obviously is intended to keep you busy longer.


If you are starting to learn chess, there is some help in the interactive diagram in the preface: Information on how pawns and pieces move, and information on how to see that a checkmate position is actually checkmate."

In order to undermine such activities he sends Anna Jirak to worm her way into Tony's household as a spy. This she does by posing as a political refugee needing a form of marriage to the now-widowed Tony in order to escape deportation.
In time the marriage becomes genuine, so when Placek turns up demanding that Anna should wreck Tony's standing by accusing him of multiple adultery with supposed refugee women, she refuses. Placek's unwelcome duty then requires him, in the course of offering Tony a session chairmanship in a forthcoming conference in Kiev, to denounce Anna as a traitor to her own family and friends. Unwilling though Tony is to believe the story, it has enough verisimilitude to create a doubt that she cannot dispel, and in despair she takes an overdose of medicine.
Determined to avenge her fate, but knowing that he must work with Placek at the Kiev conference, Tony consults his cousin Eric in the UK security service. Eric advises an indirect approach by joining an actual dissident support group. This proves to be badly run and Tony is persuaded to take charge of it.
In Kiev, Placek confides in his devoted assistant Elena about his distress at the news of Anna, whom he had regarded almost as a surrogate daughter. He instructs Elena to accompany Tony on the city tour when he expects contraband to be somehow handed over, but the plan is thwarted by local police who turn out to have been Tony's contacts.
Back home, some time later, Tony is visited by Eric together with Placek who, disgusted by new instructions from his masters, wishes to defect but needs the help of Tony's group for Elena to escape. Tony is reluctant but urged by Eric, for his own reasons, to comply. Anna, who is now revealed to have survived the suicide attempt at the cost of a partial breakdown, praises Placek's character and adds her own plea that convinces Tony to agree, and insists that the two couples should thenceforward be friends."

He has won -- and lost -- in tournaments and cash games around the globe, all the while studying the game and learning from every hand dealt. As the resident expert and cohost of Celebrity Poker Showdown, Phil has quickly become one of the most sought-after teachers of No Limit Texas Hold'em. It's a tough game. But anyone can become a winning player with the right amount of courage, patience, aggression, observation, and, perhaps most important, dedication to becoming a better player. 
 After fifteen years of keeping notes on the things he's learned, the greats he's played with, and the celebrities he's taught, Phil Gordon has poured every single thing he knows about No Limit Texas Hold'em into this little green book. Taking a page from Harvey Penick's bestselling book of golf wisdom, Phil plays the role of both teacher and student, offering up insightful tips on how to think about poker and how to develop a singular style of play. Through philosophy, psychology, strategy, math, and the knowledge gleaned from playing poker with everyone from T. J. Cloutier and Phil Ivey to Hank Azaria and Ben Affleck, Phil breaks down the game into enlightening instructional tidbits and illustrative anecdotes that inspire the kind of persistence and motivation necessary to improve your game. 
 A book to rank with Doyle Brunson's Super System and David Sklansky's The Theory of Poker, Phil Gordon's Little Green Book deserves a spot on the shelf of every serious student of the game."

Puzzle books are not simply for kids and adults too can get great enjoyment from losing themselves in a puzzle book. Indeed, in addition to simply being great fun, solving puzzles brings with it a whole host of benefits. Here are just a few:

Improved Memory. Problem solving helps to create new connections within the brain, aiding brain development and speeding up thought processes.

Improved Visual-Spatial Reasoning. Often overlooked, the ability to think not in words but in pictures is an important skill, which helps with many everyday activities like driving.

Increased IQ. Improvements in memory and reasoning combine to produce a demonstrable increase in IQ.

Lowers Stress Levels. Changes within the brain's state while engaged in puzzle solving lead to a lowering of stress.

Increased Educational Opportunities. You are never too old to learn and puzzle and general problem solving help to develop skills in areas ranging from research to mathematics and language.

Increased productivity. The combination of lower stress levels and mindfulness which accompany puzzle solving spill over into life generally and are often seen in terms of greater productivity.

Delay the onset of Demetia and Alzheimer's. Many of us fear the onset of mental problems as we age and so it is vital that we take steps to help prevent this, or at least to delay its onset. Puzzle solving is an important tool when it comes to healthy aging.

This puzzle book, based upon renaissance paintings, is just one in a growing series of Spot The Difference Puzzles For Adults covering some of the world's greatest religious paintings and other works of art."

His solo career included work as a film actor, television game show emcee, and author of The Groucho Letters, Memoirs of a Mangy Lover, and his classic autobiography, Groucho and Me.

With impeccable timing, outrageous humor, irreverent wit, and a superb sense of the ridiculous, Groucho tells the saga of the Marx Brothers: the poverty of their childhood in New York’s Upper East Side; the crooked world of small-time vaudeville (where they learned to carry blackjacks); how a pretzel magnate and the graceless dancer of his dreams led to the Marx Brothers’ first Broadway hit, I’ll Say She Is!, how the stock market crash in 1929 proved a godsend for Groucho (even though he lost nearly a quarter of a million dollars); the adventures of the Marx Brothers in Hollywood, the making of their hilarious films, and Groucho’s triumphant television series, You Bet Your Life!. Here is the life and lunatic times of the great eccentric genius, Groucho, a.k.a. Julius Henry Marx.

All are gone or near gone, and so is the old world. The traditional music industry was not built for the world of digital downloads, on-demand streams, and unlimited digital shelf space where everything (and everyone) can be available with unlimited inventory on demand.

The days of the major labels are over.  

The “New Rules For The Music Industry” in this book originated as a TuneCore blog post, and we think these rules should last longer than the 80-year-or-so run of the traditional music industry.

The rules in this book are accompanied by supporting articles, and are of value to those who will control the new music industry: the artist and the songwriter.

You can read, comment and contribute to the conversation at the TuneCore blog.

New Rules For The Music Industry:


1.	Educate Yourself
2.	Commercial Radio & MTV No Longer Singularly Break Bands
3.	Marketing Does Not Always Equal Success
4.	It’s Global
5.	Take Action
6.	Be Transparent
7.	It’s About A Constant Stream Of Music & Media, Not A Once A Year Album Release
8.	You Are Not Powerless
9.	Define Your Goals

Hired by Spielberg as a screenwriter to work with him on the set while the movie was being made, Carl Gottlieb, an actor and writer, was there throughout the production that starred Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss. After filming was over, with Spielberg's cooperation, Gottlieb chronicled the extraordinary yearlong adventure in The Jaws Log, which was first published in 1975 and has sold more than two million copies. This expanded edition includes a photo section, an introduction by Benchley, and an afterword by Gottlieb that gives updates about the people and events involved in the film, ultimately providing a singular portrait of a famous movie and inspired moviemaking."

Writing a script. Pitching to investors. Surviving development hell. Before even picking up a camera. All while juggling a family, a social life and a day job. No wonder making an independent feature film feels out of reach.

Lean Filmmaking is different.

It celebrates experimentation and inventiveness, while forging a sustainable artistic practice.

It saves time, energy and money (but it's not just for low-budget or cheap ideas).

It takes advantage of surprising - often counterintuitive - strategies to dramatically improve the filmmaking process, including:
Collaborating in non-hierarchical, cross-functional squadsWorking in ongoing iterative Make-Show-Adjust CyclesValidating assumptions with early fan feedback
If you're ready to transition from shorts, series or online videos to creating independent feature films, go from idea to launch with the five-step Lean Filmmaking method.

Get started immediately with tested techniques that will empower you to take action, bust through stumbling blocks and ignite your creativity.

""Lean Filmmaking kickstarts an entire generation of new filmmaking voices, arming them with the tools and self-reliance to create original, important stories, then connecting them with the audience who especially craves them."" -Perri Cummings and Paul Anthony Nelson, producers Trench

""Lean Filmmaking revolutionizes how filmmakers work."" -Melanie Rowland, producer Time Apart

Cheeky provocateurs and creative agitators, siblings Kylie Eddy and David Eddy have combined their filmmaking experience and agile coaching expertise to re-imagine the development, production and distribution of independent films in an uncertain world.

How to play barre chords easily and without strain.

Who is the book for?
This book will help three main categories of guitarist:
1. Beginners.
2.Frustrated guitarists who want to get the guitar out of the closet and have another crack at it.
3.People who wish to avoid strain injury.

This book took over 40 years to write! Or to be more accurate, it took me over 40 years of playing the guitar to get a conscious inventory of the barre chord technique, something I had learned within a few months of starting the guitar.

Why should that be so? Aren't barre chords an essential part of guitar technique? Yes, they certainly are. And they are also the reason most people (wisely) give up on the instrument after about 6 months.

I first documented 'the process' of how to play the barre chord back in the 1990s. Being very fortunate to have martial arts and Alexander Technique instruction when still a teenager, the barre chord came fairly easy to me. By talking about the 'gesture of expansion' I thought I had it all covered. Those who have read my earlier books will remember how little information I thought was needed to adequately explain the activity.

It was only recently that my explorations of the Feldenkrais Method led me to make conscious the connections between certain movements I had learned in the martial art Wing Chun, and the practice of the barre chord."

Earth: I am being destroyed by the most evolved of my children. I blessed them with abundance, and they filled my oceans with plastic. I blessed them with endless love from every tree and blade of grass, and they cut down my rain forests. I gave them a loving sky with clouds smiling at them, but their scientists and governments made chem-trails trying to change my nature.

I gave them endless abundance, and they spent it on machines of war to kill each other. I am sick. What must I do? The symbiotic relationship I began with The Humans has been corrupted.

Venus: I cry for you my sister.

Mars: I cry for your earthquakes and tsunamis. When will harmony be restored? Must we decree a violent end to Man?

Sun: Enough violent talk Mars. I spoke with God immediately before this assembly and He smiled. A solution is coming that will bring balance to the solar system.

God has decided to send everything. The Aliens are coming. The human messiah is coming. The digital internet of love is coming. The evil from which earth is suffering will soon be over."""

It’s shocking how many poker players stumble into this elusive state of mind. As quickly as that euphoric feeling of invincibility arrives, it's gone. And no matter how hard they try, they can’t get back there. Until now.

• Play poker longer and across more online tables.

• Improve decision making.

• Learn faster.

• Eliminate C-game mistakes.

• Increase focus and discipline.


The Mental Game of Poker 2 expands on the psychological strategies and theories from Tendler's groundbreaking book, The Mental Game of Poker, which cracked the code on managing tilt and has helped thousands of players eliminate mental leaks from their games.

border can make. It can transform one simple item to a completely different, elaborate, most beautiful crocheted item one may own. Just like a few decorative pillows add a tremendous difference to a dull-looking sofa, a beautiful border transforms any crocheted piece in the same manner. It looks better, more rounded-up, finished.

I don’t know about other crocheters, but I look at a piece that doesn’t have a border and I’m thinking ‘that’s not finished yet’. I love making nice borders on almost anything. In fact, even if I don’t make a proper border, I at least make a round of single crochet or double crochet stitches so that it gets a nice and even finish. If you don’t want some elaborate borders, you can actually work a round of single crochet stitches followed by a round of double crochet stitches that are worked in the back loops of the single crochet stitches. It makes a great edging and you can add some tassels on the corners to make it more decorative.

The ceramics of 16th-century Zen artists could be interchanged with the rugged pots of our own contemporary crafts movement; ancient calligraphies suggest the monochromes of Franz Kline or Willem de Kooning; the apparent nonsense and illogic of Zen parables (and No theater and Haiku poetry) established the limitations of language long before the theater of the absurd; 400-year-old Zen architecture seems to be a copy of modern design ideas such as modular space and a California marriage of house and garden.
Zen values experiencing things over analyzing them. Perhaps if we can take the power of direct perception, sharpened by the devices of Zen art, back to everyday activities, we will find a beauty in common objects that we previously ignored.

Selected Reviews

The notoriously grumpy Kirkus Reviews said, “Thomas Hoover has a considerable gift for expressing his appreciation and understanding of various arts associated with Zen. . . . These are deftly treated, with a concise synopsis of the historical development of each; and together Hoover’s discussions provide an excellent introduction to the aesthetics of Japanese culture.”

Library Journal said, “Hoover covers the ground in an easy and informative way, describing the origins of Zen itself and the Zen roots of swordsmanship, architecture, food, poetry, drama, ceramics, and many other areas of Japanese life. The book is packed with facts, the bibliography is excellent, the illustrations few but most appropriate, and the style clear and smooth. A most useful book for all collections.”

Asian Studies declared, “Highly recommended. ZEN CULTURE moves easily from the political climate that gave rise to Zen to the cultural areas – art, architecture, theatre, literature, flower arrangement, design, archery, swordsmanship – where Zen has manifested itself.”

As for the influence of the Zen aesthetic, the Houston Chronicle said, “Hoover suggests we need only look around. Modern furniture is clean, simple lines in unstained, unadorned woods. And that old fad became a habit, houseplants. These are all expressions of ideas born with Zen: understatement, asymmetry, intuitive perception, nature worship, disciplined reserve.”

“Highly recommended,” said The Center for Asian Studies.

“Western intellectuals have tried to represent the height of Buddhist mysticism within the pages of mere books, reducing an ineffable experience into a written report. Predictably such attempts have failed miserably. ZEN CULTURE by Thomas Hoover comes the closest to succeeding,” said Hark Publishing

“ZEN CULTURE, concerned as it is with the process of perception as much as with actual works of art, can open our sense so that we experience anew the arts of both East and West, ancient and modern.” declared the Asian Mail.

And to go multi-media, NYC-FM in New York said, “Hoover takes us on a grand tour of Zen archery and swordsmanship, flower arranging, drama, food, gardening, painting, poetry, architecture. His book is essentially one by a connoisseur.”

in inspiring you to find beauty in all forms. Since the existence
of this world, mankind have known and practiced art in
different styles. May it be the crude drawings and paintings of
the caveman or the masterpiece of Leonardo da Vinci. Art
history spans the entire account of the human race, right from
the primeval times to the 21
st century.
It is the study of objects of art and the ancient style, design
and genre that they have been made in. This includes
paintings, sculptures, architectures even furniture and other
decorative like ceramics and many more. Art History embraces
various methods to study the works of art and architecture.
The field of art is much easier to understand when divided
into three parts, which is the specialists, the critics and the art
historians.
The part played by the art critics is very imperative and
crucial, reason being they are the ones who help in establishing
a comparative artistic value to the piece of work with respect
to the works of others of the same genre. They have the
authority to sanction an entire new style or a movement or
philosophy of art and art theory, which is apprehensive with
the nature of art. There is another department of study known
as, study of Aesthetics and it majorly deals in investigating the
problem of the transcendent and defining the quintessence of
beauty. On the other hand, Art History has nothing to do with
any of these.
Art historians use historical methods to find answers to a
historical piece of art, to questions such as: How did the artist
inspire to create the particular work?, who were the
supporters?, Who was the teacher?, who were the spectators?,
who were the followers?, what historic events forced the artist's
work?, what effects did the art create socially and politically?.
Many questions like such arise for each piece of art, the art
historians' work is to find those answers. It is however,
uncertain whether or not questions like these would get a
satisfactory answers to it.
This book is on a revitalizing and awe inspiring revelation
about art history the study of Art History. The meaning of it,
and the methods used to study the artefacts by the art
historians. How it came to improve in the developing years and
different eras."

In 1999, Hollywood as we know it exploded: Fight Club. The Matrix. Office Space. Election. The Blair Witch Project. The Sixth Sense. Being John Malkovich. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. American Beauty. The Virgin Suicides. Boys Don’t Cry. The Best Man. Three Kings. Magnolia. Those are just some of the landmark titles released in a dizzying movie year, one in which a group of daring filmmakers and performers pushed cinema to new limits—and took audiences along for the ride. Freed from the restraints of budget, technology, or even taste, they produced a slew of classics that took on every topic imaginable, from sex to violence to the end of the world. The result was a highly unruly, deeply influential set of films that would not only change filmmaking, but also give us our first glimpse of the coming twenty-first century. It was a watershed moment that also produced The Sopranos; Apple’s AirPort; Wi-Fi; and Netflix’s unlimited DVD rentals.

“A spirited celebration of the year’s movies” (Kirkus Reviews), Best. Movie. Year. Ever. is the story of not just how these movies were made, but how they re-made our own vision of the world. It features more than 130 new and exclusive interviews with such directors and actors as Reese Witherspoon, Edward Norton, Steven Soderbergh, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher, Nia Long, Matthew Broderick, Taye Diggs, M. Night Shyamalan, David O. Russell, James Van Der Beek, Kirsten Dunst, the Blair Witch kids, the Office Space dudes, the guy who played Jar-Jar Binks, and dozens more. It’s “the complete portrait of what it was like to spend a year inside a movie theater at the best possible moment in time” (Chuck Klosterman)."

By telling the intimate and surprising stories from its golden age through the women (and men!) who lived it, Behind the Burly Q reveals the true story of burlesque, even as it experiences a new renaissance.

Burlesque was one of America's most popular forms of live entertainment in the first half of the 20th century. Gaudy, bawdy, and spectacular, the shows entertained thousands of paying customers every night of the week. And yet the legacy of burlesque is often vilified and misunderstood, left out of the history books.

By telling the intimate and surprising stories from its golden age through the women (and men!) who lived it, Behind the Burly Q reveals the true story of burlesque, even as it experiences a new renaissance. Lovingly interviewed by burlesque enthusiast Leslie Zemeckis who produced the hit documentary of the same name, are former musicians, strippers, novelty acts, club owners, authors, and historians--assembled here for the first time ever to tell you just what really happened in a burlesque show. From Jack Ruby and Robert Kennedy to Abbott and Costello--burlesque touched every corner of American life. The sexy shows often poked fun at the upper classes, at sex, and at what people were willing to do in the pursuit of sex. Sadly, many of the performers have since passed away, making this their last, and often only interview. Behind the Burly Q is the definitive history of burlesque during its heyday and an invaluable oral history of an American art form. Funny, shocking, unbelievable, and heartbreaking, their stories will touch your hearts. We invite you to peek behind the curtain at the burly show.

Includes dozens of never-before seen photographs: rare backstage photos and candid shots from the performers' personal collections.

Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home."

The human figure is one of the most difficult subjects to capture in drawing. The Complete Book of Poses for Artists combines photographs and illustrations that demonstrate how to accurately render the human form in hundreds of realistic poses. The book guides artists through the process of drawing the human figure as it pertains to anatomy, proportions, volume, mass, gesture, movement, and expression. From there, the book reveals how these characteristics come together using light, shape, line, and form to accurately depict the human figure in a variety of everyday poses, including standing, sitting, reclining, and action. Each section features color photographs of people in several ""core"" poses (e.g., sitting, reclining, and action), as well as multiple variations of those poses. Step-by-step artist illustrations demonstrate how to render the core pose, whereas illustrations and professional tips demonstrate how to turn the core pose into a new variation. In addition, step-by-step drawing instructions and techniques demonstrate how to capture realistic poses as they differ from one person to the next across a range of human characteristics, such as age (child, teen, adult, senior citizen); body type (ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph); gender; and activity (e.g., athlete, dancer, etc.). Packed with helpful photographs, hundreds of techniques, and loads of expert instruction, The Complete Book of Posesfor Artists is the perfect resource for artists of all skill levels-and one that will be referred to over and over again."

Almost 200,000 poker machines sing and flash in pubs, clubs, and casinos in every corner of the country. They’re highly complex devices, their components designed by mathematicians, musicians, animators, and ergonomic experts. They’re also widely considered the most harmful form of gambling, the cause of the majority of gambling addictions. So how did Australia evolve into a pokie nation?

With startlingly candid interviews from gambling addicts, politicians, manufacturers, neuroscientists, counsellors, anti-gambling campaigners, and gambling advocates, One Last Spin explores how the machines work to hook people in, and the vicious fight being waged to evict them from the country’s social life. It is a confronting tale about the human cost of addiction, of governments pandering to corporate interests, and of the insidious power of the industry’s PR spin."

Thus the vocabulary of the e (picture) moji (characters) is gradually expanding as in a living language. Moreover, by use of the technology developed for emojis, pictograms too, can be ""written"" like emojis in a line, and together with emojis they can indeed form whole sentences – starting with the pictograms for ""I"" and ""You"".

Furthermore, his ideas and approach are as relevant to players today as they were when the books were first published.

Alexander Kotov was one of the strongest players of the immediate post-war period, twice reaching the Candidates stage of the World Championship. He was also one of the leading Soviet trainers but is primarily remembered for his trilogy of classic works on chess coaching, of which Think Like a Grandmaster, one of the best-selling chess books of all time, was the first volume, and Play Like a Grandmaster the second."

In recent months, the media has reported on scores of entertainment figures who used their power and money in Hollywood to sexually harass and coerce some of the most talented women in cinema and television. But as Karina Longworth reminds us, long before the Harvey Weinsteins there was Howard Hughes—the Texas millionaire, pilot, and filmmaker whose reputation as a cinematic provocateur was matched only by that as a prolific womanizer.

His supposed conquests between his first divorce in the late 1920s and his marriage to actress Jean Peters in 1957 included many of Hollywood’s most famous actresses, among them Billie Dove, Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and Lana Turner. From promoting bombshells like Jean Harlow and Jane Russell to his contentious battles with the censors, Hughes—perhaps more than any other filmmaker of his era—commoditized male desire as he objectified and sexualized women. Yet there were also numerous women pulled into Hughes’s grasp who never made it to the screen, sometimes virtually imprisoned by an increasingly paranoid and disturbed Hughes, who retained multitudes of private investigators, security personnel, and informers to make certain these actresses would not escape his clutches.

Vivid, perceptive, timely, and ridiculously entertaining, The Seducer is a landmark work that examines women, sex, and male power in Hollywood during its golden age—a legacy that endures nearly a century later."

Whether you are a student in a screenwriting class or just someone who wants to try their hand at writing for film or television, this handy guidebook makes the entire process simple and unintimidating. Scott Winfield Sublett, a veteran screenwriter and screenwriting teacher, walks you step by step from start to finish and helps you navigate potential and unforeseen difficulties along the way, offering handy tips and suggestions to keep you from becoming blocked or stalled.

Rather than throwing you into the writing process headfirst, Sublett guides you through the various decisions you need to make—about plot, character, structure, conflict—in the order you need to make them. He explains in straightforward terms the terminology and jargon, the theory and industry standards, and dispels common myths about screenwriting that can discourage or hold back a beginning writer.

Balancing theory and practice and offering valuable and insightful examples from recognizable and well-known classic and contemporary films, ranging from Casablanca to A Christmas Story to Clerks, Sublett provides the new writer with the necessary tools to successfully write a feature-length screenplay and offers a roadmap of where to go next. With an emphasis on helping a writer not just to begin, but also to finish a script, Screenwriting for Neurotics is the screenwriting book to help you actually write one."

Delacroix's output was enormous. After his death his executors found more than 9,000 paintings, pastels, and drawings in his studio and he prided himself on the speed at which he worked, declaring 'If you are not skilful enough to sketch a man falling out of a window during the time it takes him to get from the fifth storey to the ground, then you will never be able to produce monumental work.' Among great painters he was also one of the finest writers on art. He was a voluminous letter writer and kept a journal from 1822 to 1824 and again from 1847 until his death - a marvelously rich source of information and opinion on his life and times. His influence, particularly through his use of color, was prodigious, inspiring Renoir, Seurat, and van Gogh among others. Van Gogh wrote about him: 'Only Rembrandt and Delacroix could paint the face of Christ.'"

Surrealism emerged amidst such feeling. Surrealists and Dada artists often changed from one movement to another.They were united by their superior intellectualism and the common goal to break free from the norm. Describing the Surrealists with their aversive resistance to the system, the author brings a new approach which strives to be relative and truthful. Provocation and cultural revolution: aren’t Surrealists after all just a direct product of creative individualism in this unsettled period?"

Linking somatics and politics, author Ann Cooper Albright argues that a renewed attention to gravity as both a metaphoric sensibility and a physical experience can help transform moments of personal disorientation into an opportunity to reflect on the important relationship between individual resiliency and communal responsibility.

Long one of the nation's preeminent thinkers in dance studies, Albright asks how contemporary bodies are affected by repeated images of falling bodies, bombed-out buildings, and displaced peoples, as well as recurring evocations of global economies and governments in discursive free fall or dissolution. What kind of fear gets lodged in connective tissue when there is an underlying anxiety that certain aspects of our world are in danger of falling apart? To answer this question, she draws on analyses of perception from cognitive studies, tracing the discussions of meaning, body and language through the work of Sara Ahmed, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Shaun Gallagher, among others.  In addition, she follows the past decade of debate in contemporary media concerning the implications of the weightless and two-dimensional social media exchanges on structures of attention and learning, as well as their effect on the personal growth and socialization of a generation of young adults. Each chapter interweaves discussions of movement actions with their cultural implications, documenting specific bodily experiences and then tracing their ideological ripples out through the world."

 In 2005, director Christopher Nolan reimagined and forever redefined the Batman legend when he began his epic trilogy of films—Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises—starring Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader in a fresh, dynamic reboot of the franchise.
  
 All three films would go on to blockbuster success and critical acclaim—including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger’s unforgettable performance as Batman’s eternal nemesis, the Joker.
  
The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy tells the complete story of these three monumental films. Based on in-depth interviews with Nolan and all of the films’ key cast and crew—including cowriters David S.

A thirtieth-century toxic jungle, a bathhouse for tired gods, a red-haired fish girl, and a furry woodland spirit—what do these have in common? They all spring from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki, one of the greatest living animators, known worldwide for films such as My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, and The Wind Rises.



Japanese culture and animation scholar Susan Napier explores the life and art of this extraordinary Japanese filmmaker to provide a definitive account of his oeuvre.

For many artists of late Imperial Russia – a culture deeply influenced by the regime’s adoption of Byzantine Orthodoxy centuries before – questions of religion and spirituality were of paramount importance. As artists and the wider art community experimented with new ideas and interpretations at the dawn of the twentieth century, their relationship with ‘the spiritual’ – broadly defined – was inextricably linked to their roles as pioneers of modernism.
This diverse collection of essays introduces new and stimulating approaches to the ongoing debate as to how Russian artistic modernism engaged with questions of spirituality in the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Ten chapters from emerging and established voices offer new perspectives on Kandinsky and other familiar names, such as Kazimir Malevich, Mikhail Larionov, and Natalia Goncharova, and introduce less well-known figures, such as the Georgian artists Ucha Japaridze and Lado Gudiashvili, and the craftswoman and art promoter Aleksandra Pogosskaia.
Prefaced by a lively and informative introduction by Louise Hardiman and Nicola Kozicharow that sets these perspectives in their historical and critical context, Modernism and the Spiritual in Russian Art: New Perspectives enriches our understanding of the modernist period and breaks new ground in its re-examination of the role of religion and spirituality in the visual arts in late Imperial Russia. Of interest to historians and enthusiasts of Russian art, culture, and religion, and those of international modernism and the avant-garde, it offers innovative readings of a history only partially explored, revealing uncharted corners and challenging long-held assumptions."

Part Ten examines the LP Yellow Submarine.

Going further than the usual song-by-song, album-by-album guide, it is a record of every moment that the Beatles came together to record, from the first EMI session in 1962 to their acrimonious break-up in 1970. In short, this 12-volume set is the blueprint to every single recording made by the Beatles: 12 albums and 22 singles which make a portfolio of 208 songs that undeniably changed the shape of modern music forever.
From 'Love Me Do' to 'Let It Be', Steve Lambley provides full analysis of every track not only for its lyrical meaning, its position in the Beatles catalogue and the impact it made on the charts, but also from the point of the science of the songs. Thanks to the author's astute understanding of just how music works, as well as the recording processes of the day, this book includes a level of a musical analysis rare to career-spanning tomes today.

The book includes a detailed description of the recording process of every track, with a breakdown of the instrumentation and details of overdubs. What's more, And the Band Begins to Play explains the wealth of production innovations and recording techniques used by the group which continues to inform popular music today.

The story of the group's music also tells the story of the group itself. The book therefore takes the reader by the hand on a magical tour through the conquering of America, the band's film, TV and radio appearances, the ""bigger than Jesus"" storm, the death of Brian Epstein, the Maharishi experience, the rise and fall of the original Apple business, and much more.

The appendices include detailed listings covering all the Beatles' recordings, including:

- the original source of every quote used in the book
- a complete UK and US discography
- a chronology of all songs
- the dates and take numbers of all recordings

Unquestionably, the Beatles remain the key band of the rock era. And the Band Begins to Play tells the story of their unique musical legacy."

Teacher's organizations would do well to consider the use of Miss Grant's Technical Manual as an official textbook."" — Dance Magazine
Teacher recommended, Gail Grant's Technical Manual has long been one of the most popular and effective ballet reference guides. Completely revised and updated, this third edition is virtually a new work and should be owned by every student, dance teacher, choreographer, and ballet enthusiast — even those who purchased the second edition. Extensive revision, expansion, and the inclusion of more than 300 new terms have added immeasurably to the value of this concise, definitive manual.
Moving from ""abstract ballet"" and ""adage, adagio"" to ""working leg"" and ""wrapped position,"" the book fully describes and defines over 1,100 ballet steps (saul de chat, jeté enveloppé, failli, entrechat six, etc.), movements and poses (arabesque, épaulement, attitude, en arrière, retiré, à terre, dégagé, etc.), and other expressions and concepts. For each, first a phonetic transcription is provided, then a literal translation, and finally an explanation of how the step is performed, the pose captured, or the movement executed, of how the concept fits in with actual ballet dancing, or of the purpose or function of the idea. A pronunciation guide, cross-references to alternate names for similar steps and positions that vary from the Russian to the French or Italian schools, and a bibliography are all invaluable aids.
But the most important supplement is the 15-page pictorial section, drawn by the author, who is both a successful ballet teacher and dancer. Keyed to the dictionary (and vice-versa), these diagrams show clearly the exact foot, leg, arm, and body positions for the proper execution of many of the more common ballet steps and movements. This essential and easy reference is a must for every teacher, aspiring dancer, and ballet class."

Book 2 presents the five basic categories of jumps so you can explore allegro steps and sequences without travel, timed to music. In Book 3 new BMN theory will prepare you to read notated examples of centre work and repeated sequences. You’ll explore how a basic dance phrase can be repeated in a variety of ways: the same, other side, alternating sides, or reverse.

The cards you are using are, however, conventional poker cards, so there is no need to spend money on collecting them.
DRAGONS RPG can be used in any setting, ranging from fantasy over apocalyptic or horror to science fiction, so that adventures from other franchises can be easily adapted and played with DRAGONS RPG.
There is no need for dice or dice rolls, all randomness comes from drawing or playing cards. This makes combat more of a strategically interesting experience and far quicker than systems where lots of dice must be rolled in order to determine the effect of a single attack.
Like a classical pen and paper role playing game, DRAGONS RPG should be played with a game master. Cooperation is very important, and the possibility to trade cards with your allies during combat and the fact that every character can use cards for different effects, makes combat very tactical and interesting."

Signaled by the triumph of abstraction and the ascendancy of painters such as Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, and Kline, this revolution generated an exuberant and contentious body of writing without parallel in our cultural history. In the words of editor Jed Perl, “there has never been a period when the visual arts have been written about with more mongrel energy—with more unexpected mixtures of reportage, rhapsody, analysis, advocacy, editorializing, and philosophy.” Perl has gathered the best of this writing together for the first time, interwoven with fascinating headnotes that establish the historical background, the outsized personalities of the artists and critics, and the nature of the aesthetic battles that defined the era. Here are statements by the most significant artists, and major critical essays by Clement Greenberg, Susan Sontag, Hilton Kramer, and other influential figures. Here too is an electrifying array of responses by poets and novelists, reflecting the free interplay between different art forms: John Ashbery on Andy Warhol, James Agee on Helen Levitt, James Baldwin on Beauford Delaney, Truman Capote on Richard Avedon, Tennessee Williams on Hans Hofmann, Jack Kerouac on Robert Frank. The atmosphere of the time comes to vivid life in memoirs, diaries, and journalism by Peggy Guggenheim, Dwight Macdonald, Calvin Tomkins, and others. Lavishly illustrated with scores of black-and-white images and a 32-page color insert, this is a book that every art lover will treasure."

Now his student, screenwriter and novelist Salva Rubio, applies Blake’s principles to 50 independent, auteur, European and cult films (again with 5 beat sheets for each of Blake’s 10 genres).

From international sensations like The Blair Witch Project to promising debuts like Pi, from small films that acquired cult status like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to Euro-blockbusters like The Full Monty, from unexpected gems like Before Sunrise to textbook classics such as The 400 Blows, from Dogville to Drive and Boogie Nights to Cinema Paradiso, here are 50 movies that fit both the “indie” label and Blake Snyder’s 15 beats.

You’ll find works from Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, David Lynch, Roman Polanski, Danny Boyle, David Mamet, Spike Jonze, Charlie Kaufman, Sofia Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Woody Allen, Wes Anderson, and the Coen Brothers, among other renowned writers and directors.

If you’re a moviegoer, you’ll discover a language to analyze film and understand how filmmakers can effectively reach audiences.

If you’re a writer, this book reveals how those who came before you tackled the same challenges you are facing with the films you want to write.

With these 50 beat sheets, you’ll see how “hitting the beats” creates stories that resonate the world over."

What do the hawthorn and primrose symbolize? Or President Snow’s roses and Peeta’s bread? What about Katniss’s last name? Bringing details from myths, herbal guides, military histories, and the classics, English professor and award-winning pop culture author Valerie Estelle Frankel sheds light on the deeper meanings behind Panem’s heroes and villains in this hottest of YA trilogies. In her series, Collins not only weaves a heroic tale of deep complexity but harnesses the power of Shakespeare and Rome to retell an ancient epic of betrayal, violence, and glory on the stage of an apocalyptic future.

Millions of readers around the world have been swept away by the nonstop action and poignancy of The Hunger Games. But what most readers don’t know is that there’s a library’s worth of history, plant lore, and mythology behind the world of Panem. Now, with Katniss the Cattail, those without access to Collins’s bookshelf can discover the fascinating reality behind Panem.

Katniss the Cattail allows curious readers to look up all the names of Panem and discover a wealth of entertaining, unexpected information. Blight, Cato, and Clove have names that predict their grisly ends, while the evening primrose represents eternal love, youth, and sadness. Boggs was a civil war general, Plutarch a biographer who wrote skewed critiques on Coriolanus and Caesar. There’s a reason Johanna Mason knows more than she’s telling and that Cressida and Messalla betray the Capitol.
From Alma Coin to Wiress you’ll learn about
•Why roses are a flower of death
•How eighteen of the characters are used in Shakespeare’s plays
•Katniss’s nickname Catnip
•The meaning of “The Hanging Tree”
•Peeta’s pearl and Katniss’s salvation
•Effie the saint and Finnick the Irish hero

""If you're a fan of The Hunger Games, you need this book! Period...I devoured this book the moment I opened my mailbox. Every time I read something “new” about a character, my brain started turning."" --The Flashlight Reader

""Full of thought provoking observations, Katniss the Cattailis a quick, clean read for any fan of The Hunger Games trilogy."" --Sarah's Reviews

How can we make space and time in our lives to know ourselves? 

One way is through music - learning music, listening to music, being open to music. Because music consoles and restores us. Through music, whether we are listening or playing, we know ourselves more intimately, more honestly, and more clearly with every note. And with every note, music offers us a hand to the beyond. 

Through music, we can say what we didn't even know we felt.

This book is an ode to music, and a celebration of humanity's greatest creation. It is not a call to arms, but a call to instruments.

In music, Ed Ayres finds answers to the big questions life throws at us. Using personal anecdotes - including those relating to his transition from Emma to Ed - and observations from teaching and learning music, Ed finds hope in our desire to become whole, with some simple music lessons along the way."

The dramatic eight days covered in this book, from November 27 through December 4, 1989, represent a turning point for Nirvana. In this brief period, the young band goes from breaking up in Rome to winning over the influential music press in London at Sub Pop’s LameFest UK showcase, setting the stage for their imminent popularity. 


On November 27, 1989, when my business partner Jon Poneman and I arrived to meet the band in Rome, they were almost finished with a grueling six week tour of Europe. Although determined to promote their grungy, riff-heavy debut album, Bleach, their travels with fellow Sub Pop act Tad had left them exhausted. Providing label support, Jon and I did our best to revive the spirits of a frustrated and downcast Kurt Cobain, who then managed to continue to London where Nirvana played the biggest and most important show of their career to date.


LameFest UK, held at the 2,000-capacity Astoria Theatre, featured three Seattle Sub Pop acts: Nirvana, Tad and popular headliners Mudhoney. Although Nirvana opened the show, their heart-pounding performance won over the crowd as well as the powerful British press, who went on to proclaim that Nirvana was, ""Sub Pop's answer to The Beatles."" It was then that the world's attention began to focus on the band that would become the biggest rock act of their generation.


A portion of proceeds will go to the Vera Project in Seattle, Washington. Vera is an all-ages volunteer fueled music and arts venue. By engaging participants at all levels of music production and community organizing, Vera strives to fulfill its mission to foster a participatory creative culture through popular music concerts, arts programs, experiential learning and volunteer opportunities for all ages, especially young people."

Joseph Cornell (1903–1972) is best known for his exquisite and alluring box constructions, in which he transformed found objects—such as celestial charts, glass ice cubes, and feathers—into enchanted worlds that blur the boundaries between fantasy and the commonplace. Situating Cornell within the broader artistic, cultural, and political debates of midcentury America, this innovative and interdisciplinary account reveals enchantment's relevance to the history of American modernism.

In this beautifully illustrated book, Marci Kwon explores Cornell's attempts to convey enchantment—an ephemeral experience that exceeds rational explanation—in material form. Examining his box constructions, graphic design projects, and cinematic experiments, she shows how he turned to formal strategies drawn from movements like Transcendentalism and Romanticism to figure the immaterial. Kwon provides new perspectives on Cornell's artistic and graphic design career, bringing vividly to life a wide circle of acquaintances that included artists, poets, writers, and filmmakers such as Mina Loy, Lincoln Kirstein, Frank O’Hara, and Stan Brakhage. Cornell's participation in these varied milieus elucidates enchantment's centrality to midcentury conversations about art's potential for power and moral authority, and reveals how enchantment and modernity came to be understood as opposing forces. Leading contemporary artists such as Betye Saar and Carolee Schneemann turned to Cornell's enchantment as a resource for their own anti-racist, feminist projects.

Spanning four decades of the artist's career, Enchantments sheds critical light on Cornell's engagement with many key episodes in American modernism, from Abstract Expressionism, 1930s ""folk art,"" and the emergence of New York School poetry and experimental cinema to the transatlantic migration of Symbolism, Surrealism, and ballet."

That's a long time ago. Back then, we were worrying about the Millennium Bug, paying $700 for DVD players, and using pagers. 1999: a century ago.

And yet, the show continues to have an impact that is arguably unique. If you live or work in DC, references to it are inescapable. People have walked down the aisle to the theme music. Or they’ve named children, pets, GPS systems, and even an iPhone app after the characters. Or they’ve started Twitter accounts as the characters to continue the storyline and comment on current political events. Or they credit it for closer relationships with their family members or a way out of depression.

In this anthology of quotes and essays, contributors from six countries, ranging in age from twenty to seventy years old, tell their West Wing stories."

Although, while that’s what they’re called in the post-iTunes world, back when they were first recorded and released, the songs discussed and celebrated in this book had been collectively known as ‘singles’, and came engraved on slabs of shellac (between 1949 and 1958 or so) and vinyl (from 1955 to 1995 or so). The singles of the latter half of the 20th century were two-sided, with the designated ‘A’ side being the version that record companies wanted radio stations and jukeboxes to play, and considered to be commercially stronger than the ‘B’ side (which often appeared only on a single’s ‘B’ side and wasn’t usually included on any subsequent LP release). Please bear with me if this is all a little ‘duhhh’ for those of you old enough to have grown up owning singles, and caring desperately whether your single was going to make the charts each week; there are now at least two generations of music fans for whom the idea of having to leave the house, travel to a specialist store, and ask someone if they could listen to a single before buying it—and receiving a physical object, wrapped in a specially designed sleeve when they hand over hard cash—is plain weird. You try telling kids today that you had to physically hunt out music and travel vast distances just to hear anything other than mainstream pop music, and they will probably laugh at you. They’d probably ask ‘Why should you care so much?’

Hopefully, this book will help explain some of why music fans of the rock ‘n‘ roll era and beyond care so much about music. The singles included are not listed in any kind of charts format, nor is it a list of singles you must hear before you die. Many of the singles included here were not the biggest-selling records of the year of their release. However, all of them are considered important milestones in the history of popular music, and all meant something to the writers who’ve chosen to highlight them. The singles included in this book add up to a short history of popular music as viewed from the hip side. There are major, mainstream hits in here, but equally there are the marginal but inspirational singles which never sold in any significant number outside of the home state of the record label who released it. There are no wilfully obscure singles to be found in this book, although there are some arguably perverse choices for ‘Single of the year’. Who’d agree that ‘My Boy Lollipop’ deserves the accolade for 1964 ahead of ‘A Hard Day’s Night?’

Prepare to be intrigued, amazed, possibly irritated — but always inspired to search out copies of each single in order to hear the magical sounds of each year between 1949 and 1999."

In researching this phenomenal story, Nick Hasted spent much time in Detroit, tracking down friends and foes of Marshall Mathers. In racially-divided Detroit the future rapper experienced first-hand the social conflicts that would fuel his later radicalism. From the depths of being a suicidal no-hoper, he triumphed against his class and triumphed against prejudice; despite being continually reviled, sued and criticised, Marshall Mathers forged his way to becoming a defining cultural force of the early millennium.

This unflinching portrait also lays bare Eminem's relationships with his much-hated mother, his teenage soul-mate Kim Scott, his mentors Dr. Dre and The Bass Brothers, and his own protégé 50 Cent. Never before has a book delved so deep an poignantly into this troubled figure.

Hula, the indigenous dance of Hawai'i, preserves significant aspects of Native Hawaiian culture with strong ties to health and spirituality. Kumu Hula, persons who are culturally recognized hula experts and educators, maintain and share this cultural tradition, conveying Hawaiian history and spiritual beliefs in this unique form of cultural and creative expression, comprising specific controlled rhythmic movements that enhance the meaning and poetry of the accompanying songs.

Emphasizing the importance of cultural literacy, the Handbook begins with an overview of the origins of hula, its history in Hawai'i, and the primacy of the spiritual focus of the dance. The book goes on to introduce halau etiquette and practices, and explains the format of a traditional hula presentation, together with the genres of hula and the regalia worn by the dancers. Practical components include sections on Hawaiian language and chant and a glossary of hula commands and footwork.

Author Mahealani Uchiyama trained in Hawaii in the hula lineage of Joseph Kamoha'i Kaha'ulelio and is currently the Kumu Hula at the Halau Ku Ua Tuahine in Berkeley, California. As the founder and artistic director of the Center for International Dance and board member of Dance Arts West, the producers of San Francisco's annual Ethnic Dance Festival, Uchiyama's approach to hula is deeply holistic and reflects her background in indigenous wisdom traditions and cultural exchange and interaction."

Poker is America’s national card game, and its popularity continues to grow. Nationwide, you can find a game in progress everywhere. If you want to play, you can find poker games on replicas of 19th century riverboats or on Native American tribal lands. You can play poker at home with the family or online with opponents from around the world. Like bowling and billiards before it, poker has moved out from under the seedier side of its roots and is flowering in the sunshine. 
Maybe you’ve never played poker before and you don’t even know what a full house is. Poker For Dummies covers the basics. Or perhaps you've played for years, but you just don’t know how to win. This handy guide will help you walk away from the poker table with winnings, not lint, in your pockets. If you’re a poker expert, you still can benefit – some of the suggestions may surprise you, and you can certainly learn from the anecdotes from professional players like T.J. Cloutier and Stu Unger.

Know what it takes to start winning hand after hand by exploring strategy; getting to know antes and betting structure; knowing your opponents, and understanding the odds. Poker For Dummies also covers the following topics and more:
 Poker games such as Seven-Card Stud, Omaha, and Texas Hold'em Setting up a game at home Playing in a casino: Do's and don'ts Improving your play with Internet and video poker Deciphering poker sayings and slang Ten ways to read your opponent's body language Playing in poker tournaments Money management and recordkeeping Knowing when and how to bluff  
Poker looks like such a simple game. Anyone, it seems, can play it well – but that's far from the truth. Learning the rules can be quick work, but becoming a winning player takes considerably longer. Still, anyone willing to make the effort can become a good player. You can succeed in poker the way you succeed in life: by facing it squarely, getting up earlier than the next person, and working harder and smarter than the competition.

Foreword by Chris Moneymaker, 2003 World Series of Poker Champion."

 The Lady in Gold, considered an unforgettable masterpiece, one of the twentieth century’s most recognizable paintings, made headlines all over the world when Ronald Lauder bought it for $135 million a century after Klimt, the most famous Austrian painter of his time, completed the society portrait.
  
 Anne-Marie O’Connor, writer for The Washington Post, formerly of the Los Angeles Times, tells the galvanizing story of the Lady in Gold, Adele Bloch-Bauer, a dazzling Viennese Jewish society figure; daughter of the head of one of the largest banks in the Hapsburg Empire, head of the Oriental Railway, whose Orient Express went from Berlin to Constantinople; wife of Ferdinand Bauer, sugar-beet baron.
  
 The Bloch-Bauers were art patrons, and Adele herself was considered a rebel of fin de siècle Vienna (she wanted to be educated, a notion considered “degenerate” in a society that believed women being out in the world went against their feminine “nature”). The author describes how Adele inspired the portrait and how Klimt made more than a hundred sketches of her—simple pencil drawings on thin manila paper.
  
 And O’Connor writes of Klimt himself, son of a failed gold engraver, shunned by arts bureaucrats, called an artistic heretic in his time, a genius in ours. 
  
 She writes of the Nazis confiscating the portrait of Adele from the Bloch-Bauers’ grand palais; of the Austrian government putting the painting on display, stripping Adele’s Jewish surname from it so that no clues to her identity (nor any hint of her Jewish origins) would be revealed. Nazi officials called the painting, The Lady in Gold and proudly exhibited it in Vienna’s Baroque Belvedere Palace, consecrated in the 1930s as a Nazi institution. 
  
 The author writes of the painting, inspired by the Byzantine mosaics Klimt had studied in Italy, with their exotic symbols and swirls, the subject an idol in a golden shrine.
  
 We see how, sixty years after it was stolen by the Nazis, the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer became the subject of a decade-long litigation between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs, how and why the U.S. Supreme Court became involved in the case, and how the Court’s decision had profound ramifications in the art world. 
  
 A riveting social history; an illuminating and haunting look at turn-of-the-century Vienna; a brilliant portrait of the evolution of a painter; a masterfully told tale of suspense. And at the heart of it, the Lady in Gold—the shimmering painting, and its equally irresistible subject, the fate of each forever intertwined."

Introduction to Shipping Container Homes:

Shipping container homes are houses that are built using shipping containers. The strength, durability, availability, and the cost effectiveness of containers as building material has made these types of homes popular in recent years. When you buy a container, it might appear as hollow boxes with no windows or openings. However, these boxes are highly customizable; they can be stacked and welded together to create beautiful yet economical homes. The next section is about the pros and cons of living in a shipping container home."

Using the new systems of making and distributing music to their advantage, they have proved that compromises don’t need to be made at the expense of good music, if you have the backing of an audience. They made indie music a profitable and attractive prospect, a gift for which the British music scene should be very grateful. Whether they continue to break new barriers remains to be seen, but if they continue in the way that they have to date, then they will surely cement their position as one of the most important British groups in the history of popular music. This eBook traces the Arctic Monkeys story from their early days in Sheffield to fame and stardom as the world wide rock phenomenon that we know today. Also included is a complete track-by-track analysis of the band’s studio releases. This is essential for any Arctic Monkeys fan."

Basic head layout
There are few characteristics of a head that is relative to almost everyone, this similarity in measurements will be your guide if you are to construct a face when drawing a portrait.
The eyes are positioned below, above or right at the center of the head’s perfect-center level. It is usually aligned with the upper tip of the ear.
The head’s space above and below the eyes’ location are equal.
The nose wings are usually aligned with the tear ducts, and its nose ball is aligned with the ear lobes (this similarity changes depending on the person’s age as the ears grow bigger).
Both tips of the mouth are nearly aligned with the center of both eyes.

Although you will surely encounter a person that has a little difference on these measurements, it would be easier for you to identify his or her unique proportion value if you have the knowledge about what is most usual.

The familiarity to different angles of the head is essential when drawing faces.

Head shapes differ in every angle. The position of each facial feature gradually changes as the head makes a quarter turn. And as it turns further on one side, their sizes slightly change and the features reveal their unseen angles, thus, totally changing their shape.

A head facing in a perfect front view would have two equal sides most of the time, while a head in a quarter angle view shows the outline of the nose bridge which cannot be portrayed perfectly when in front view. The lips would reveal its thickness as it loses the exposure of its further tip. And the further ear and eye will lose its exposure as the head turns further on the side.

These natural gradual adjustments happen when the head moves horizontally.

Unlike horizontal movements, when a head moves in a diagonal direction it changes the diagonal thickness of the head dynamically, thus, the facial features follow.
Each facial feature comes closer together as the head leans further. The nostrils become totally exposed as the nose ball clearly establish its distance from the plane (face surface).

The thickness of the lower lip can be easily conveyed as it overlaps the upper lip, and the eye shapes would appear flat.
When the head moves downwards, the nose (depending on its height) would overlap the lips, and the eyebrows (depending on its thickness) would slightly overlap the eyes. The height of the neck would be hidden as the top of the head becomes clearly conveyed, totally changing or rather hiding the face’s horizontal height.

The facial ridges of males are more defined and prominent compared to females, especially the nose bridge, Brow Bridge and the jaw line.

But there are few cases in which the shape of a man’s profile looks more feminine than usual or vice-versa. In this case, you have to rely on the facial features he or she have to clearly portray his or her gender, such as thick eyebrows or any facial hairs for men or pouty, glossy lips and long eyelashes for women."

In the two decades before the Civil Rights movement, jazz nightclubs were among the first places that opened their doors to both Black and white performers and club goers in Jim Crow America. In this extraordinary collection, Jeff Gold looks back at this explosive moment in the history of Jazz and American culture, and the spaces at the center of artistic and social change. 

Sittin’ In is a visual history of jazz clubs during these crucial decades when some of the greatest names in in the genre—Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Oscar Peterson, and many others—were headlining acts across the country. In many of the clubs, Black and white musicians played together and more significantly, people of all races gathered together to enjoy an evening’s entertainment. House photographers roamed the floor and for a dollar, took picture of patrons that were developed on site and could be taken home in a keepsake folder with the club’s name and logo.

Sittin’ In tells the story of the most popular club in these cities through striking images, first-hand anecdotes, true tales about the musicians who performed their unforgettable shows, notes on important music recorded live there, and more. All of this is supplemented by colorful club memorabilia, including posters, handbills, menus, branded matchbooks, and more. Inside you’ll also find exclusive, in-depth interviews conducted specifically for this book with the legendary Quincy Jones; jazz great tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins; Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion critic Robin Givhan; jazz musician and creative director of the Kennedy Center, Jason Moran; and jazz critic Dan Morgenstern.

Gold surveys America’s jazz scene and its intersection with racism during segregation, focusing on three crucial regions: the East Coast (New York, Atlantic City, Boston, Washington, D.C.); the Midwest (Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Kansas City); and the West Coast (Los Angeles, San Francisco). 

This collection of ephemeral snapshots tells the story of an era that helped transform American life, beginning the move from traditional Dixieland jazz to bebop, from conservatism to the push for personal freedom."

Are you a weekend carpenter that wants to make traditional Japanese joints?

Do you want to apply Japanese ingenuity of design to everyday furniture and give them a special character?

Do you want to do so without spending a lot of time or money?

For centuries before the invention of screws and fasteners, Japanese craftsmen used complex, interlocking joints to connect pieces of wood for structures and beams, helping to create a unique Japanese aesthetic that can still be seen in the works of modern masters like Shigeru Ban.

Up until recent times, however, these techniques were often the carefully guarded secrets of family carpentry guilds and unavailable for public knowledge.

Let this book teach you the secrets from an era when craftsmanship mattered, prior to the industrial revolution and mass production of ""things"".

Inside this book you'll discover:
How to make your own Japanese joints in 8 stepsThe #1 Japanese wood you should use to make jointsThe top 5 tools you need to get started with most Japanese jointsThe secret behind how Japanese joinery is used to construct buildings that have stood for hundreds of years8 Tradional joints and 3 beginner friendly projects
Here are the answers to some questions you might have about this book:
  
Q: I'm just a woodworker with a wood shop in my garage, and I don't want to splurge on expensive tools just for making Japanese joints. Can I still make the joints given inside your book?

A: Absolutely, this book is designed for the weekend woodworker and enthusiast!

While we still recommend a few tools that are cheap but absolutely key when making Japanese joints, we have omitted the joints that require any type of expensive tools from this guide.

There also certain joints that don't require any specialized tools.

So, you don't need to spend extra if you don't really want to.

Q: Can Japanese joints really improve regular objects (like chairs and other furniture) that I already know how to make?

A: Yes. The special characteristics of Japanese joints are diverse.

Their utility can be found in making flexible yet strong houses in earthquake-prone Japan.

They are also useful in building recording-studios where sound-transmission through joist-conduction must be minimized.

There also certain joints that don't even need nails to make!

The addition of Japanese joints in your own designs will incorporate one or more of these characteristics to your furniture.

We also have short guide on adapting these joints into your own designs, so you never get lost trying to make sense of it all.

Q: Are the pictures in your book color or b/w?

A: The pictures inside this book are b/w illustrations meant to show clearly the intricacies of the joints.

Every day that you delay is another day you miss the opportunity to use this magnificient craft to make your woodworking projects a notch above everything else.

The development of this school was largely due to Mme. Vaganova (1879–1951), not only a great dancer but also the teacher of Galina Ulanova and many others and an unsurpassed theoretician.
The principles of Vaganova's system are presented in this well-known book. Mme. Vaganova's aim of creating a personal approach to the Russian dance was based on the critical assimilation of the experience of her contemporaries. Her ability to choose the best of what had been accomplished in the various ballet traditions (French, Italian, and Russian) and combine these into a unified teaching practice in itself amounted to a new school of dance. She firmly believed that the teaching process should be a planned exercise, ever changing with innovations in the dance. She sought from her pupils emotional expressiveness, strictness of form, a resolute, energetic manner of performance, and the understanding of the underlying coordination of movements.
Her book discusses all basic principles of ballet, grouping movements by fundamental types. Chapters cover battements, rotary movements of the legs, the arms, poses of the classical dance, connecting and auxiliary movements, jumps, beats, point work, and turns as well as material for a sample lesson. Diagrams show clearly the exact foot, leg, arm, and body positions for the proper execution of many steps and movements. The result is a fundamental theory of dance that offers dancers, teachers, and ballet lovers information often difficult to locate in other books.

The Republic has bought peace and unity to the galaxy. A thousand years of prosperity and progress will now reign.
Or that is how it was meant to be.
30 years ago the Emperor, Darth Vader and their Imperial dreams were ended by a plucky band of rebels. Peace reigned. But then the attacks started. Assassinations and bombings, targeting administrations, royal dynasties, ruling parties. Fear started to grip the galaxy once again. That fragile peace that was so hard fought for seemed to be falling apart, as a frightened population turned to demagogues and started to yearn the security they once felt in the “good old days”… under the Empire!
In an attempt to counter this unseen threat, Queen Leia Organa, now an elder statesman in the Galactic council on the royal planet Rassalas, has despatched a fighting force led by Admiral Solo, to track down the insurgents and to restore stability. While Jedi Master Luke Skywalker works to bring balance and lasting peace back to the galaxy, through a new generation of Jedi.
But will the combined firepower of the Republic be enough to defeat this dark menace which seems to be one step ahead of their best laid plans? Are they underestimating the threat that they face?"

But this oil painting guidebook aims to break down this seemingly exacting subject matter into manageable pieces.

Within you will find step-by-step instructions on completing 10 old master portraits in oil. Leaving no stone unturned, portrait painting would seem more possible.

Each demonstration comprises an overview of a particular oil painting technique to be explored, in-depth step-by-step instructions and (on average) 16 images in progress.

The old masters featured include Botticelli, Delacroix, Gauguin, Velazquez, Wright of Derby, Jacques-Louis David, Rossetti and Vermeer. An additional demonstration features a modern-day portrait.

Subjects of various ages, sexes and ethnicity help the developing portraitist get to grips with portraying most skin types in painting.

As well as these demonstrations, preliminary sections offer guidance on the art materials required, preparing for oil painting and a personal view of portrait painting. At the back of this book can be found remedial techniques for portraiture, a troubleshooting guide and a glossary.

These features make this book an invaluable guide for the beginner as well as the developing portraitist.

My other book 'Skin Tones in Oil: 10 Step by Step Guides from Old Masters' similarly outlines demos on painting portraits, and also figures. Source material include Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Caravaggio.

A troubleshooting guide for portraitists 'Why do My Skin Tones Look Lifeless Plus 25 Solutions to other Portrait Painting Peeves' might also be of interest.

Written by one of the most widely read and respected art critics of our time as an outgrowth and expansion of his major eight-part BBC Time-Life television series, it recounts the origins of modern painting, sculpture, and architecture; discusses the careers of the major artists; shows how their work was shaped by the cataclysmic events of the new century; makes plain why modernism has today very nearly run its course – and does all this with verve, command of anecdote and scholarship, and a critical poise that is nothing short of dazzling. In eight fascinating chapters Robert Hughes explores the cultural fruit of nineteenth-century industrialism, the legacy of World War I, art in the lyric mode, the glorious failure of modern architecture, the outbreak of irrationality, the art of extreme emotion, art gripped by the media, why the avant-garde is no more, and where, if anywhere, art goes from here ... Deeply informed, dashingly written, wonderfully illustrated (more than 250 pictures, nearly all in full color, constituting in themselves an extraordinary gallery of great works of modern art), The Shock of the New is history and art criticism at their most appealing and accessible, a book to learn from -- and to delight in."

It's a journey through time and space spread over a couple of decades and founded in a mostly familiar world, a journey of a few thousand miles, a travelogue of sorts which became a Quest for signs and symbols and art rooted in an earlier time. Much of it was stimulated by the desire of man in the past to create a pattern, linking the material world to the spiritual one, a pattern created in another time which I found myself being drawn into. The quest for hidden meanings is a kind of treasure hunt, allied with the desire to be ""in the know"".

There’s an old saying in the screenwriting trade:

“Write from the gut and rewrite from the head.”

And most writers do just that, which is why their first screenplay draft tends to be anything but a true “first” draft. Chances are, by the time a screenwriter is done writing “from the gut” and is ready to call that ""first draft” a done deal, they’ve poured over their work, page-by-page, a dozen times or more.

Next comes the challenge of rewriting “from the head” in the hope of realizing every last bit of the potential inherent in their original screen story vision. But there’s a problem… their first draft is already close to perfect... at least from their point of view. After all, why would they have written it any other way?

You will then move right along to playing different notes and songs, first with one hand and then with two. Melodic and harmonic intervals are covered, as well as a series of finger “aerobics” that will improve your playing skills and make the pieces in the book easier to play.

Audio examples and video lessons are integrated throughout the book so you can see and hear an experienced piano teacher guiding you through every step. Video lessons clearly show the left and right hands, and onscreen music notation is highlighted as the music plays so you can easily follow along.

 ""This fascinating and detailed book about acting is Miss Hagen's credo, the accumulated wisdom of her years spent in intimate communion with her art. It is at once the voicing of her exacting standards for herself and those she [taught], and an explanation of the means to the end."" 
 --Publishers Weekly

 ""Hagen adds to the large corpus of titles on acting with vivid dicta drawn from experience, skill, and a sense of personal and professional worth. Her principal asset in this treatment is her truly significant imagination. Her 'object exercises' display a wealth of detail with which to stimulate the student preparing a scene for presentation."" 
 --Library Journal

 ""Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting . . . is a relatively small book. But within it, Miss Hagen tells the young actor about as much as can be conveyed in print of his craft."" 
 --Los Angeles Times

 ""There are almost no American actors uninfluenced by Uta Hagen."" 
 --Fritz Weaver

 ""This is a textbook for aspiring actors, but working thespians can profit much by it. Anyone with just a casual interest in the theater should also enjoy its behind-the-scenes flavor.""

Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon’s movies have made over a billion dollars at the box office—and now they show you how to do it yourself! This book is full of secret insider information about how to conquer the Hollywood studio system: how to write, pitch, structure, and get drunk with the best of them. Well…maybe not the best of them, but certainly the most successful. (If you’re aiming to win an Oscar, this is not the book for you!) But if you can type a little, and can read and speak English—then you too can start turning your words into stacks of money!

This is the only screenwriting book you will ever need (because all other ones pretty much suck). In these pages, Garant and Lennon provide the kind of priceless tips you won’t find anywhere else, including:

-The art of pitching
 -Getting your foot in the door
 -Taking notes from movie stars
 -How to get fired and rehired
 -How to get credit and royalties!

And most important: what to buy with the huge piles of money you’re going to make!

Writing Movies for Fun and Profit will take you through the highs and lows of life as a professional screenwriter. From the highs of hugging Gisele Bündchen and getting kung fu punched by Jackie Chan to the soul-crushing lows of Herbie: Fully Loaded.

Read this book and you’ll have everything you need to make your first billion the old-fashioned way—by “selling out” in show business!

A portion of the authors’ proceeds from this book are being contributed to the USO of Metropolitan Washington, a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to serving active duty military members and their families in the greater Washington, DC, region."

In Landscape Painting, Mitchell Albala shares his concepts and practices for translating nature's grandeur, complexity, and color dynamics into convincing representations of space and light.  Concise, practical, and inspirational, Landscape Painting focuses on the greatest challenges for the landscape artist, such as: •  Simplification and Massing: Learn to reduce nature's complexity by looking beneath the surface of a subject to discover the form's basic masses and shapes.•  Color and Light: Explore color theory as it specifically applies to the landscape, and learn the various strategies painters use to capture the illusion of natural light.•  Selection and Composition: Learn to select wisely from nature's vast panorama. Albala shows you the essential cues to look for and how to find the most promising subject from a world of possibilities. The lessons in Landscape Painting—based on observation rather than imitation and applicable to both plein air and studio practice—are accompanied by painting examples, demonstrations, photographs, and diagrams. Illustrations draw from the work of more than 40 contemporary artists and such masters of landscape painting as John Constable, Sanford Gifford, and Claude Monet.  Based on Albala's 25 years of experience and the proven methods taught at his successful plein air workshops, this in-depth guide to all aspects of landscape painting is a must-have for anyone getting started in the genre, as well as more experienced practitioners who want to hone their skills or learn new perspectives."

Symbols are a way of conveying visual meaning, somewhat similar to metaphor or simile, however metaphor and simile use clear analogous relations between the metaphor and the meaning.  This book will endeavour to attest the paradigm that semiotics is a way of revealing subtext in codes and symbols, that consequently semiotics can be used to differentiate between metaphor and symbol which will then be used to argue for symbol's usage in independent films, both as a more cost effective means of production and as a more artistic affective way of making films than is the realist method.  Using definitive examples this essay will attempt to verify that abundant independent filmmakers have managed to both keep their independence, by making cost effective films, and have added to film's expressive language by making symbolic films."

Art scams are increasingly convincing and involve incredible sums of money. The cons perpetrated by unscrupulous art dealers and their accomplices are proportionately elaborate. 

Anthony M. Amore's The Art of the Con tells the stories of some of history's most notorious yet untold cons.  They involve stolen art hidden for decades; elaborate ruses that involve the Nazis and allegedly plundered art; the theft of a conceptual prototype from a well-known artist by his assistant to be used later to create copies; the use of online and television auction sites to scam buyers out of millions; and other confidence scams incredible not only for their boldness but more so because they actually worked.  Using interviews and newly released court documents, The Art of the Con will also take the reader into the investigations that led to the capture of the con men, who oftentimes return back to the world of crime.  For some, it's an irresistible urge because their innocent dupes all share something in common: they want to believe."

He wrote top hits for many well-known artists, including Don Gibson, Andy Williams, Kenny Rogers, Tom Jones, and others. He is probably best known, however, for being name-checked in the song “Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)” by Waylon Jennings. Newbury has been cited by Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, Townes Van Zandt, and many other eminent singer-songwriters as a primary influence.

In his own independent fashion, Newbury helped to loosen the grip maintained for decades by the Nashville studio system, thus paving the way for later innovators like Willie Nelson, David Allan Coe, and others. He is still the only songwriter to produce hits on four different charts in the same year in 1968: “Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition was In)” on the pop/rock charts, “Sweet Memories” on easy listening, “Time Is a Thief” on the R & B charts, and “Here Comes the Rain, Baby” in country.

Following the successful pattern established in his previous works on Townes Van Zandt and Ray Wylie Hubbard, veteran music journalist Brian T. Atkinson has interviewed artists such as Kris Kristofferson, Bobby Bare, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, Steve Earle, Rodney Crowell, and many others to learn how Newbury’s influence continues to shape the musical and artistic approach of both seasoned and newer performers. Forewords by Larry Gatlin and Don McLean set the stage for a fascinating look back at one of the most revered songwriters and musicians of recent decades."

The play is a favourite for study by English literature and theatre classes in Britain and the United States. It is one of the few plays from the 18th century to have an enduring appeal, and is still regularly performed today. It has been adapted into a film several times, including in 1914 and 1923. Initially the play was titled Mistakes of a Night, and indeed, the events within the play take place in one long night. In 1778 John O'Keeffe wrote a loose sequel, Tony Lumpkin in Town. Wealthy countryman Mr. Hardcastle arranges for his daughter Kate to meet Charles Marlow, the son of a wealthy Londoner, hoping the pair will marry. Unfortunately Marlow is nervous around upper-class women, yet the complete opposite around lower-class females. On his first acquaintance with Kate, the latter realises she will have to pretend to be common, or Marlow will not woo her."

Xanthias and Dionysus argue over what kind of jokes Xanthias can use to open the play.

An essential book for our times and all artists at whatever level. In her most passionate and personal book to date, acclaimed watercolour artist Ann Blockley takes both budding and more experienced artists through a series of ideas for working with nature – in its widest sense – to nurture our creativity, inspire us, make us more sustainable artists, and replenish energy and flow when our artistic streams run dry.

In ‘Go Outside and Play’, the author exhorts artists to recapture a fun, no-pressure way of being outside and use that feeling when creating. In ’Connecting Materials to Place’ she creates her own paint from the local pond. In ‘The Slow Movement’, the artist reveals her year of working on a specific local hedgerow and painting a series of different interpretation in its every-changing detail. She created regular creative rituals, using her weekly playing card as a starting point for a new painting to reflect the season each week. She reuses old paintings, and tissue and paper – wabi-sabi style – to create new textures and even new paintings. 

Including work from other artists as well as her own, she shows the ideas and work from textile and mixed-media artists. From allotment inspiration to reusing old painting and from nature prints to the alchemy of found materials, this is a journey to find new creativity through our connection with our natural world."

In his early stand-up days, if he walked on stage and didn’t like the crowd, he would walk off. Together with Jerry Seinfeld, he pitched NBC on a sitcom where nothing happens. A whole show could be about waiting in line at a Chinese restaurant. And somehow Seinfeld became the most successful comedy show of all time.

After nine years of writing and producing Seinfeld, and after making a huge amount of money, Larry David began to create a new show for HBO. Without much separation between himself and the character he plays, Curb follows the daily routines of Larry David. Being politically correct is far from Larry’s mind, and the audience cringes as he berates, torments, and blusters his way into the hearts of TV watchers.

Follow the early exploits of Larry’s stand-up career, his days writing for Seinfeld, and learn how Curb was conceived and developed. Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Good — titled after Larry’s key catchphrase — also explores Larry’s on- and off-screen relationships with famous pals like Richard Lewis, Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, and the cast of Seinfeld, and contains an in-depth episode guide to Curb Your Enthusiasm."

Two-time Academy Award winner Olivia de Havilland is best known for her role as Melanie Wilkes in Gone with the Wind. She often inhabited characters who were delicate, elegant, and refined; yet at the same time, she was a survivor with a fierce desire to direct her own destiny on and off the screen. She fought and won a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute that changed the studio contract system forever. She is also noted for her long feud with her sister, fellow actress Joan Fontaine—a feud that lasted from 1975 until Fontaine’s death in 2013.

Victoria Amador draws on extensive interviews and forty years of personal correspondence with de Havilland to present an in-depth look at her life and career.Amador begins with de Havilland’s childhood—she was born in Japan in 1916 to affluent British parents who had aspirations of success and fortune in faraway countries—and her theatrical ambitions at a young age. The book then follows her career as she skyrocketed to star status, becoming one of the most well-known starlets in Tinseltown. Readers are given an inside look at her love affairs with iconic cinema figures such as James Stewart and John Huston, and her onscreen partnership with Errol Flynn, with whom she starred in The Adventures of Robin Hood and Dodge City. After she moved to Europe, de Havilland became the first woman to serve as the president of the Cannes Film Festival in 1965, and remained active in film and television for another two decades.

Olivia de Havilland: Lady Triumphant is a tribute to one of Hollywood’s greatest legends, tracing her evolution from a gentle heroine to a strong-willed, respected, and admired artist."

He died without ever growing old.’ Michael Parkinson

‘Comic genius’ was the uncontested verdict of the International Herald Tribune. But Robert Morley was bigger even than that. While he is remembered for landmark performances such as the first portrayal of Oscar Wilde on stage and screen, and for many more as the epitome of the crusty but lovable English gentleman, Robert Morley is equally remembered for perhaps his finest role: playing himself. Through books, plays and countless radio and television performances, Robert Morley spread his own unique brand of irresistible humour and joie de vivre, generally resembling, to quote one memorable description, ‘an indignant elephant’. In this wonderfully entertaining account of a remarkable life, Sheridan Morley reveals the true Robert Morley – actor, playwright, bon viveur, and, not least, father.

 An astonishingly versatile instrument, the piano allows just two hands to play music of great complexity and subtlety.

From financially deprived but emotionally rich beginnings, Matt sees his fortunes literally turned upside-down, with all the fame, glamour and money he could hope for violently snatched away from him.

Matt Goss has been a staple part of British tabloid life for years – yet, the general public has had no idea of the astounding life that he has led – and still lives – behind the headlines and sound-bites. Here, for the first time, he takes them into his confidence and reveals the true extent of his own astounding tale.

Matt was brought up in a proudly close but financially frustrated south London family with twin brother Luke and his mother. Fortunes changed rapidly for Matt when, alongside his brother Luke and school friend Craig, he created Bros – a band that sold sixteen million records in an intensely chaotic and record-breaking reign over the world's pop charts. By the end of his teens, Matt could boast eleven Top 40 hits, number ones in nineteen countries, a Brit Award and the record for being the youngest band to headline Wembley Stadium.

Bros became a by-word for mercurial celebrity extravagance, hysterical fan stories, financial scandal, personal tragedy, tortuous upset and glorious triumph. Yet after those bizarre and insane times, Matt's life became even more tempestuous, crammed with inner fear, personal revelation and unforeseen challenges.

He is now back with a vengeance after spells on TV's Hell's Kitchen, finding a new audience through his acclaimed solo music career, which has already included chart-topping soundtracks and further Top 40 hits, plus his appearance in 2013’s Strictly Come Dancing Christmas contest.

Here he finally tells the true story of his life, revealing a litany of private torment, personal revelations and celebrity anecdotes.

This is the account of a man who can truly say that he has experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, to have held the world in his hand and seen it snatched away from him in the blink of an eye, yet has the strength of character and personal insight to continue to claim to be 'truly blessed'.

About the author

Along with his brother Luke and friend Craig Logan, Matt fronted the ‘80s pop sensation Bros. After unprecidented success, Bros disbanded in 1991, but hits such as ‘When Will I Be Famous’ and ‘I Owe You Nothing’ have been used on countless film and tv soundtracks. Matt Goss made a comeback with his album Early Side of Later and his hit single ‘Fly’, and has made numerous high-profile television appearances, including ITV’s Hell’s Kitchen and most recently, After the Screaming Stops."

A work of romantic fiction, better known as a comedy of manners, Sense and Sensibility is set in southwest England, London and Kent between 1792 and 1797, and portrays the life and loves of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. The novel follows the young ladies to their new home, a meagre cottage on a distant relative's property, where they experience love, romance and heartbreak. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin argues that Sense and Sensibility has a “wobble in its approach”, which developed because Austen, in the course of writing the novel, gradually became less certain about whether sense or sensibility should triumph. Austen characterizes Marianne as a sweet lady with attractive qualities: intelligence, musical talent, frankness, and the capacity to love deeply. She also acknowledges that Willoughby, with all his faults, continues to love and, in some measure, appreciate Marianne. For these reasons, some readers find Marianne's ultimate marriage to Colonel Brandon an unsatisfactory ending. Other interpretations, however, have argued that Austen’s intention was not to debate the superior value of either sense or sensibility in good judgment, but rather to demonstrate that both are equally important but must be applied with good balance to one another"

In The Restless Kings Nick Barratt presents the tumultuous struggle for supremacy between the first Plantagenet king, Henry II, and his four sons.

'Look Back in Anger presents post-war youth as it really is. To have done this at all would be a significant achievement; to have done it in a first play is a minor miracle. All the qualities are there, qualities one had despaired of ever seeing on stage - the drift towards anarchy, the instinctive leftishness, the automatic rejection of ""official"" attitudes, the surrealist sense of humour . . . the casual promiscuity, the sense of lacking a crusade worth fighting for and, underlying all these, the determination that no one who dies shall go unmourned.' Kenneth Tynan, Observer, 13 May 1956

'Look Back in Anger . . . has its inarguable importance as the beginning of a revolution in the British theatre, and as the central and most immediately influential expression of the mood of its time, the mood of the ""angry young man"".' John Russell Taylor"

At the same time, Hepburn's refined and charming personality captured her fans' hearts, and her charity work was an important part of her life up until her final years. 

With her characteristic and unique blend of tomboy, ballerina and socialite personas, Hepburn worked hard to make her way into the ranks of Hollywood A-listers, but never forgot to stay true to her roots and genuinely care for those in need. After a childhood that was marked with tragedy and hardship, from losing her father to enduring the trials of World War II, Hepburn persevered and quickly became a role model for many people.

We are pleased to offer excerpts from three of the most popular chess books available today. They are The ChessCafe Puzzle Books 1 and 2 by German grandmaster Karsten Müller and Book 3, also  by Müller, and in cooperation with Dutch international master Merijn van Delft.  All three books are available in both traditional, hard copy and electronic editions. The original books are published in figurine algebraic notation, with Informant-style evaluation symbols. For this Puzzle Sampler, we have converted the notation to simple English algebraic and replaced the Informant-style evaluation symbols with text.  The ChessCafe Puzzle Book 1 combines clear discussions of tactical themes with over 600 well-chosen positions to test, challenge and teach. Although the classic combinations are not ignored, the great emphasis is on positions from modern tournament practice of the last decade.  From CCPB1, four puzzles with different tactical themes. It is Black to move in Puzzles 1 and 2, White to move and Puzzles 3 and 4. Solutions are immediately after the four puzzles.  The ChessCafe Puzzle Book 2 takes on the more difficult and less tangible aspect of positional play. As most chess instructors and players know, it is much more difficult to teach and learn strategic concepts than tactics. The author not only presents puzzles to solve, but also presents examples of different strategic ideas. Here is an excerpt from the section about Outposts.  One of the most important skills a chessplayer needs is the ability to defend a position that is under siege. In the third volume in the highly acclaimed, best-selling ChessCafe Puzzle Book series, international grandmaster Karsten Müller, along with international master Merijn van Delft, examines and expounds upon the vital defensive concepts and techniques used to repulse enemy attacks.  From CCPB3, three puzzles with different themes. It is Black to move in all three puzzles. Solutions are immediately after the three puzzles."

The story of four sexually depraved, sadistic and homicidal SS officers who systematically defile and decimate the wretched, denuded human cattle who are in their captivity, Salò is a bleak catalogue of degradation, vaginal and anal rape, sodomy, coprophilia, torture and annihilation. It remains not only Pasolini’s last completed film project – he was brutally murdered shortly after its post-production – but perhaps a terminal project for the artfom itself: the film that kills all film.

""A knockabout, well-researched take on the working and domestic life of Shakespeare."" The Guardian

It’s the 1590s. William Shakespeare – brought to life on screen by the inimitable David Mitchell – is at the start of his career.  But no one is taking him seriously. In London, he is mercilessly mocked by his rivals and at home in Stratford he is belittled by his sullen teenage daughter. 

Yet he is determined to find an ending for his newest creation Romeo and Juliet. Luckily, inspiration is forthcoming. The trials and tribulations of his closest friends and family reveal the plot twists he’d been missing. And not only for this famous tragedy but for many of his finest plays. 

With sparkling wordplay, hilarious gags and his trademark wit, Ben Elton celebrates the great William Shakespeare and reveals the startling stories behind the playwright’s best-known plays."

Focusing on Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, each contributor applies to it a different methodology, ranging from the more traditional to the newer, including feminism, Marxism, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and semiotics. By demonstrating the ways that individual practitioners actually apply the various methodological insights that inform their research, Twelve Views of Manet's ""Bar"" serves as an excellent introduction to critical methodology as well as a provocative overview for those already familiar with the current discourse of art history. In the process of gaining new insight into Manet's work, and into the discourse of methodology, one discovers that it is not only the individual painting but art history itself that is under investigation. An introduction by Richard Shiff sets the background with a brief history of Manet scholarship and suggestions as to why today's accounts have taken certain distinct directions. The contributors, selected to provide a broad and balanced range of methodological approaches, include: Carol Armstrong, Albert Boime, David Carrier, Kermit Champa, Bradford R. Collins, Michael Paul Driskel, Jack Flam, Tag Gronberg, James D. Herbert, John House, Steven Z. Levine, and Griselda Pollock."

Polti synthesised all drama as belonging to combinations of 36 situations. In the book he illustrates each 'situation' with examples from classical and French theatre.

 When Mike Figgis used the book as an aid in putting together a treatment for a film, he found that his landscape of creativity had altered quite radically and ideas came forth with relative ease.He realised that Polti's book was system of reference which could be a powerful tool for writers. So he began updating all of the references, moving the focus away from theatre and focussing primarily on cinema. 

 In the first half, each 'Dramatic Situation' is laid out under the 36 headings. The specific 'Situation' is then explained more fully, followed by an example from a specific film, accompanied by an explanation of how the device is used in the film. In the second half of the book there are a series of charts which analyse 150 great films (of all genres) based on the 36 situations."

When Elizabeth Cady Stanton penned the Declaration of Sentiments for the first women’s rights convention, held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848, she unleashed a powerful force in American society. In A Sisterhood of Sculptors, Melissa Dabakis outlines the conditions under which a group of American women artists adopted this egalitarian view of society and negotiated the gendered terrain of artistic production at home and abroad. 

Between 1850 and 1876, a community of talented women sought creative refuge in Rome and developed successful professional careers as sculptors. Some of these women have become well known in art-historical circles: Harriet Hosmer, Edmonia Lewis, Anne Whitney, and Vinnie Ream. The reputations of others have remained, until now, buried in the historical record: Emma Stebbins, Margaret Foley, Sarah Fisher Ames, and Louisa Lander. At midcentury, they were among the first women artists to attain professional stature in the American art world while achieving international fame in Rome, London, and other cosmopolitan European cities. In their invention of modern womanhood, they served as models for a younger generation of women who adopted artistic careers in unprecedented numbers in the years following the Civil War.

At its core, A Sisterhood of Sculptors is concerned with the gendered nature of creativity and expatriation. Taking guidance from feminist theory, cultural geography, and expatriate and postcolonial studies, Dabakis provides a detailed investigation of the historical phenomenon of women’s artistic lives in Rome in the mid-nineteenth century. As an interdisciplinary examination of femininity and creativity, it provides models for viewing and interpreting nineteenth-century sculpture and for analyzing the gendered status of the artistic profession."

Meyer Guggenheim, a Swiss immigrant, founded a great American business dynasty. At their peak in the early twentieth century, the Guggenheims were reckoned among  America's wealthiest, and the richest Jewish family in the world after the Rothschilds. They belonged to Our Crowd, that tight social circle of New York Jewish plutocrats, but unlike the others -- primarily merchants and financiers -- they made their money by extracting and refining copper, silver, lead, tin, and gold.

The secret of their success, the patriarch believed, was their unity, and in the early years Meyer's seven sons, under the leadership of Daniel, worked as one to expand their growing mining and smelting empire. Family solidarity eventually decayed (along with their Jewish faith), but even more damaging was the paucity of male heirs as Meyer and the original set of brothers passed from the scene.

In the third generation, Harry Guggenheim, Daniel's son, took over leadership and made the family a force in aviation, publishing, and horse-racing. He desperately sought a successor but tragically failed and was forced to watch as the great Guggenheim business enterprise crumbled.

Meanwhile, ""Guggenheim"" came to mean art more than industry. In the mid-twentieth century, led by Meyer's son Solomon and Solomon's niece Peggy, the Guggenheims became the agents of modernism in the visual arts. Peggy, in America during the war years, midwifed the school of abstract expressionism, which brought art leadership to New York City. Solomon's museum has been innovative in spreading the riches of Western art around the world. After the generation of Harry and Peggy, the family has continued to produce many accomplished members, such as publisher Roger Straus II and archaeologist Iris Love.

In The Guggenheims, through meticulous research and absorbing prose, Irwin Unger, the winner of a Pulitzer Prize in history, and his wife, Debi Unger, convey a unique and remarkable story -- epic in its scope -- of one family's amazing rise to prominence."

In 25 years, Kaufman, along with partner Michael Herz, has built Troma Studios up from a company struggling to find its voice in a field crowded with competitors to its current--and legendary--status as a lone survivor, a bastion of true cinematic independence, and the world's greatest collection of camp on film.

As entertaining and funny as it is informative and insightful, Make Your Own Damn Movie! places Kaufman's radically low-budget, independent-studio style of filmaking directly in the reader's hands. Thus we learn how to: develop and write a knock-out screenplay; raise funding; find locations and cast actors; hire a crew; obtain equipment, permits, and music rights (all for little or no money); make incredible special effects for $0.79 each; charm, schmooze, and network while on the film-festival circuit; and, finally, make a bad actor act so bad it's actually good.
From scriptwriting and directing to financing and marketing, this book is brimming with utterly off-the-wall, decidedly maverick, yet consistently proven advice on how to fully develop one's idea for an independent film."

The Comic Toolbox is a straightforward, often humorous, workbook approach to comedy writing as creative problem solving.  In it, veteran Hollywood comedy writer John Vorhaus offers his tools of the trade to writers, comics, and anyone else who wants to be funny.  Among these indispensable tools are Clash of Context, Tension and Release, The Law of Comic Opposites, The Wildly Inappropriate Response, and The Myth of the Last Great Idea.


Readers will learn that comedy = truth and pain (the essence of the comic situation), that fear is the biggest roadblock to comedy (kill your ferocious editor within and rich, useful comic ideas will flow), and much, much more.


With Vorhaus’ tools in hand, anyone can be funny.


John Vorhaus’ writing credits include episodes of The Wonder Years, Head of the Class, and Married…With Children.  He has taught writing at the UCLA Extension Writers Program, the American Film Institute, and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.  Before turning to comedy writing, Vorhaus worked as an advertising copywriter and a folk musician.  His comic essays have appeared in the Los Angeles Times and other publications."

A self-taught child prodigy who met with early and resounding success, Doré ranks among the most prolific and popular illustrators of all time. Known as ""the master of the fantastic,"" he excelled in conveying dramatic action in memorable settings. This original collection assembles for the first time Doré's best work depicting knights and their adventures. It features eighty-six captivating scenes of battles, damsels, dragons, and other images from the Age of Chivalry.
Advances in science and technology introduced irrevocable changes to the society of Doré and his contemporaries and aroused a nostalgia for simpler times. The moral certitude and stability embodied in Arthurian myths and other medieval romances proved as appealing to Victorians as they do to modern audiences. This collection features highlights from eight volumes that span more than two decades of Doré's career, including scenes from Tennyson's Idylls of the King.

 For sixty years, since the birth of United Artists, the studio landscape was unchanged. Then came Hollywood’s Circus Maximus—created by director Steven Spielberg, billionaire David Geffen, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who gave the world The Lion King—an entertainment empire called DreamWorks. Now Nicole LaPorte, who covered the company for Variety, goes behind the hype to reveal for the first time the delicious truth of what happened.
  
 Readers will feel they are part of the creative calamities of moviemaking as LaPorte’s fly-on-the-wall detail shows us Hollywood’s bizarre rules of business. We see the clashes between the often-otherworldly Spielberg’s troops and Katzenberg’s warriors, the debacles and disasters, but also the Oscar-winning triumphs, including Saving Private Ryan. We watch as the studio burns through billions of dollars, its rich owners get richer, and everybody else suffers. LaPorte displays Geffen, seducing investors like Microsoft’s Paul Allen, showing his steel against CAA’s Michael Ovitz, and staging fireworks during negotiations with Paramount and Disney. Here is a blockbuster behind-the-scenes Hollywood story—up close, glamorous, and gritty."

It features exclusive content pulled from the Lucasfilm archives by author J. W. Rinzler: 


 – 26 minutes of rare behind-the-scenes video

 – 29 minutes of rare audio interviews with the cast and crew

 – New bonus photos and artwork not found in the print edition


After the 1973 success of American Graffiti, filmmaker George Lucas made the fateful decision to pursue a longtime dream project: a space fantasy movie unlike any ever produced. Lucas envisioned a swashbuckling SF saga inspired by the Flash Gordon serials, classic American westerns, the epic cinema of Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa, and mythological heroes. Its original title: The Star Wars. The rest is history, and how it was made is a story as entertaining and exciting as the movie that has enthralled millions for more than thirty years—a story that has never been told as it was meant to be. Until now. 


Using his unprecedented access to the Lucasfilm Archives and its trove of “lost” interviews, photos, production notes, factoids, and anecdotes, Star Wars scholar J. W. Rinzler hurtles readers back in time for a one-of-a-kind behind-the-scenes look at the nearly decade-long quest of George Lucas and his key collaborators to make the “little” movie that became a phenomenon. It’s all here: 


 – the evolution of the now-classic story and characters—including “Annikin Starkiller” and “a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills” named Han Solo

 – excerpts from George Lucas’s numerous, ever-morphing script drafts
 – the birth of Industrial Light & Magic, the special-effects company that revolutionized Hollywood filmmaking

 – the studio-hopping and budget battles that nearly scuttled the entire project

 – the director’s early casting saga, which might have led to a film spoken mostly in Japanese—including the intensive auditions that won the cast members their roles and made them legends

 – the grueling, nearly catastrophic location shoot in Tunisia and the subsequent breakneck dash at Elstree Studios in London

 – the who’s who of young film rebels who pitched in to help—including Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma


But perhaps most exciting, and rarest of all, are the interviews conducted before and during production and immediately after the release of Star Wars—in which George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, composer John Williams, effects masters Dennis Muren, Richard Edlund, and John Dykstra, Phil Tippett, Rick Baker, legendary production designer John Barry, and a host of others share their fascinating tales from the trenches and candid opinions of the film that would ultimately change their lives. 


No matter how you view the spectrum of this phenomenon, The Making of Star Wars stands as a crucial document—rich in fascination and revelation—of a genuine cinematic and cultural touchstone."

Unlike a performance where you've had the opportunity to practice your steps many times before displaying them to an audience, the audition process can be a completely unfamiliar and nerve wracking experience, requiring you to face new challenges outside of your comfort zone.

- What to wear?
- What companies are out there?
- What can I expect?
- When and how should I audition?
- Where should I stay?
- What should my resume look like?
- How do I find companies to audition for?

Luckily for you, having experienced my fair share of auditions, I have compiled this book to guide you in your ventures. This short volume in the ""Aspiring Ballerina's Guide to"" series is designed to help ballet dancers identify these challenges and give themselves the best chance of success in an audition.

Alfred’s Basic Adult Piano Course is the leading method used by piano teachers all over the world – and yes, it has been translated in many languages.  And now you have the opportunity to teach yourself from this very special edition as well. 

What is truly unique about this 3-volume edition is that every song has an audio track that allows you to hear the song while following the music page.  In addition, there is a video of Dr. Gayle Kowalchyk, a university trained piano teacher, not only describing any new elements on the page, but performing the piece as well.  You get to see Gayle’s hands as she performs the piece, while the music she is playing is highlighted above her hands.  This means you can simultaneously see the music and hear the piece as she plays. 

And if that is not enough, there is Gayle on an audio recording talking to you as a teacher might, pointing out how to practice the page, what to watch for, what is new, and how to have a successful performance.  There is no reason you can’t be playing very easy versions of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, Aura Lee, the Mexican Hat Dance, Au claire de la lune, Jingle Bells, Merrily We Roll Along, Largo (from the New World), Mary Ann, and ending with the very popular, When the Saints Go Marching In, in a very short time. 

We begin our course right from the beginning, starting with how to sit at the piano.  You’ll soon learn about the keyboard, the names of the notes, and how to read from a music staff.  Also included in Volume 1 are how to play the C major, G7th, and F major chords.

It gives detailed explanations of game art techniques and their importance, while also highlighting their dependence on artistic aspects of game design and programming.”
 
— John Romero, co-founder of id Software and CEO of Loot Drop, Inc.

""Solarski’s methodology here is to show us the artistic techniques that every artist should know, and then he transposes them to the realm of video games to show how they should be used to create a far more artful gaming experience ... if I were an artist planning to do video game work, I’d have a copy of this on my shelf.""

— Marc Mason, Comics Waiting Room

Video games are not a revolution in art history, but an evolution. Whether the medium is paper or canvas—or a computer screen—the artist’s challenge is to make something without depth seem like a window into a living, breathing world. Video game art is no different. 
 
Drawing Basics and Video Game Art is first to examine the connections between classical art and video games, enabling developers to create more expressive and varied emotional experiences in games. Artist game designer Chris Solarski gives readers a comprehensive introduction to basic and advanced drawing and design skills—light, value, color, anatomy, concept development—as well as detailed instruction for using these methods to design complex characters, worlds, and gameplay experiences. Artwork by the likes of Michelangelo, Titian, and Rubens are studied alongside AAA games like BioShock, Journey, the Mario series, and Portal 2, to demonstrate perpetual theories of depth, composition, movement, artistic anatomy, and expression.
 
Although Drawing Basics and Video Game Art is primarily a practical reference for artists and designers working in the video games industry, it’s equally accessible for those interested to learn about gaming’s future, and potential as an artistic medium.

Rather than viewing video games and literature as contenders for precious time, the students examined the ways literature and video games connect with and shape one another. This eBook is the product of that exploration.


This book is seventeen chapters of close reading and critical writing. Each author chose a video game and literature pair, with a few authors opting for more numerous literary sources. Some chapters question the notion of games as art. Others examine whether one medium succeeds at narrative better than the other. Still others explore the affordances and constraints of these expressive mediums. While all take a unique position, what ties them all together is an attention to the ways users interface with these forms of human and machine expression."

From Jordan Matter, YouTube star and New York Times–bestselling author of Dancers Among Us, a celebration of what it means to be young and full of possibility, featuring gorgeous photographs of well-known dancers (including Tate McRae and Sofie Dossi) as well as stars in the making.

 Jordan Matter is known to millions for his 10 Minute Photo Challenge YouTube videos. Now, in one dazzling photograph after another, he portrays dancers—ages 2 through 18—in ordinary and extraordinary pursuits, from hanging with friends to taking selfies, from leaping for joy to feeling left out. The subjects include TV and internet stars like Chloé Lukasiak, Kalani Hilliker, Nia Sioux, and Kendall Vertes, as well as boys and girls from around the neighborhood. What they all share is the skill to elevate their hopes and dreams with beauty, humor, grace, and surprise. Paired with empowering words from the dancers themselves, the photographs convey each child’s declaration that they were born to dance.

Advocating for the adoption of open-source design based on a new modular standard, the book shows how the construction industry and architectural practice may soon be radically reshaped. By leveraging the existing intermodal freight transport system, global supply chains can be harnessed to realize the long-held promise that housing will be a well-designed and affordable industrial product. We are on the cusp of a transformative change in the way we design and build our cities.

Author David Wallance argues that modular architecture is profoundly intertwined with globalization, equitable urbanism, and sustainable development. His book addresses these timely issues through a specific approach grounded in fundamental concepts. Going beyond the individual modular building, Wallance forecasts the emergence of a new type of design, manufacturing, and construction enterprise. 

Written in an approachable style with illustrated examples, the book is a must read for professionals in architecture and design, city planning, construction, real estate, as well as the general reader with an interest in these topics."

Its methods have shaped military strategy and tactics, even up to the present day. Along the way, many have found its teachings valuable for a host of non-martial fields, such as business, management, and sports. Indeed, its lessons on how to embrace conflict, and turn disadvantage into advantage, are universally appealing.

Now, Sun Tzu’s timeless work offers its wisdom and insight to the competitive poker player. Players at all levels will find a multitude of lessons to help them maintain discipline, find their “center,” and raise their play to the level of a master. This book is not merely a commentary on the original masterpiece. Rather, it is an adaptation of the famous military treatise, changing the language and context from warfare to the game of poker, while preserving the style and tempo of the original work.

Models for figure drawing, painting, or sculpting are traditionally nude. This 9th book in the Art Models series, however, is all about the non-nude figure, finally making this acclaimed reference available to younger artists. Now anyone can study the figure at length and in close-up detail anytime and anywhere.



Practice your technique, design a scene, study anatomy and drapery, make a finished portrait, do some gesture sketching. The uses of these photos are limited only by your own creativity. Artists wishing to practice—or even create finished works of art—will find a lot to inspire them. Instructors can refer students of many ages to this book for practice and reference. And the publisher gives full permission to do whatever you wish with the artwork created using Art Models 9 as a reference.



Art Models 9 has several formats. In the standard ebook, 74 poses are shown in 94 full-page photos. The “Enhanced” ebook adds links to all the views of every pose on a companion website for over 1,800 photos. There is also a Companion Disk, which has all the photos in maximum resolution for use on a PC, Mac, or laptop.

 

Every artist has a unique perspective and Art Models 9 includes a wide range of poses for maximum variety. For example, there are technical poses like simple standing, contrapposto, and the “T-pose” but also action poses like jumping and kicking as well as sitting and reclining. There are also some quiet moments, portraying mood through posture and lighting. Portraits and expressions round out the mix. The lighting is varied; some photos are evenly lit while others are more chiaroscuro, giving ample opportunity to observe the effects of shadowing. Clothing varies from simple drapery with arms crossed over the chest, to underwear, ordinary street cloths, and costumes.



Please note that photos and links in ebooks can be tricky. They may not work in some situations. Please download a sample to make sure all the features work on your reader."

Raised by missionaries, Jimmie Blacksmith, a young Aboriginal man, is poignantly caught between the ways of his black forefathers and those of the white society to which he aspires. Exploited by his boss and betrayed by his (white) wife, he declares war on his white employers and goes on a violent killing spree. 


The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith was one of the most significant films of the 1970s ‘renaissance’. It was the first Australian feature in which the whole story is told from an Aboriginal perspective and it broke new ground in dealing with one of the most tragic aspects of Australian history: the racist treatment of the Aboriginal population. The spectre of the violent and vengeful black had barely been touched upon and the depth of rage that the film put on screen was unprecedented in Australian film at the time."

The Anatomy of Story is his long-awaited first book, and it shares all of his secrets for writing a compelling script. Based on the lessons in his award-winning class, Great Screenwriting, The Anatomy of Story draws on a broad range of philosophy and mythology, offering fresh techniques and insightful anecdotes alongside Truby's own unique approach for how to build an effective, multifaceted narrative. Truby's method for constructing a story is at once insightful and practical, focusing on the hero's moral and emotional growth. As a result, writers will dig deep within and explore their own values and worldviews in order to create an effective story. Writers will come away with an extremely precise set of tools to work with—specific, useful techniques to make the audience care about their characters, and that make their characters grow in meaningful ways. They will construct a surprising plot that is unique to their particular concept, and they will learn how to express a moral vision that can genuinely move an audience.

The foundations of story that Truby lays out are so fundamental they are applicable—and essential—to all writers, from novelists and short-story writers to journalists, memoirists, and writers of narrative non-fiction."

Fallen Crest High

Mason and Logan Kade are two brothers who did their own thing. They were rich and expected to attend Samantha's school, Fallen Crest Academy. They chose public school and now she has to live with them. The problem is that she doesn't care at all: about them, about her friends, about her cheating boyfriend, or even about her parent's divorce. But maybe that's a good thing. Maybe change is a good thing.

This book contains adult/mature young adult situations.

Fallen Crest Family
Samantha and Mason are together. Everyone knows it. Not everyone is dealing with it. While Mason's ready to give them the middle finger, there's one not going away. Her mother. Threats are issued. Ultimatums are given. Even blackmail is used, but only Samantha can put a stop to Analise. However, when a trauma from her past is triggered, she may not have the courage or strength to do what's needed. If she doesn't, Mason's future could be destroyed.

Fallen Crest Public
Sam's first day at Fallen Crest Public doesn't go well. Some girls want to be her. Some girls want to destroy her. And some just don't like her. All in all, despite being protected by Mason and Logan, it's still only the strong survive. Sam will not only have to survive, she needs to learn how to conquer too, but there's another battle growing. Things are about to come to a disastrous end between the towns, Roussou and Fallen Crest. Sam's other main dilemma? Keeping Mason and Logan from getting arrested or hospitalized."

A multi-award-winning actor, writer, comedian and presenter known for his warmth, humour and inspired impressions, Rob Brydon has quickly become one of our very favourite entertainers. But there was a time when it looked like all we'd hear of Rob was his gifted voice.

Growing up in South Wales, Rob had a passion for radio and soon the Welsh airwaves resounded to his hearty burr. However, these were followed by years of misadventure and struggle, before, in the TV series Marion and Geoff and Gavin and Stacey, Rob at last tickled the nation's funny bone. The rest, as they say, is history. Or in his case autobiography.

Small Man in a Book is Rob Brydon's funny, heartfelt, honest, sometimes sad, but mainly funny, memoir of how a young man from Wales very, very slowly became an overnight success.

Rob Brydon was brought up in Wales, where his career began on radio and as a voiceover artist. After a brief stint working for the Home Shopping Network he co-wrote and performed in his breakthrough show, the darkly funny Human Remains. He has since starred in the immensely popular Gavin and Stacey, Steve Coogan's partner in The Trip, and was the host of Would I Lie to You? and The Rob Brydon Show. He now lives in London with his wife and five children."
