Very clear and precise - It explains all the features of the 5D Mk3 and does this in a very clear and precise way, giving a detailed run through of the camera functions and controls as well as the operation and options of the menu system - and it does this without assuming you are an expert photographer to begin with. This is an excellent book to help with getting to grips with the Canon 5DIII, whether as a newcomer to the EOS world or upgrading from a previous version.

Will Save You A Month On The Learning Curve - This book clearly and practically walks the reader through every step of setting up and using the 5D3. A wonderfully well-organized book, it explains every feature and setting on the camera with recommendations on optimal setup choices and the reasoning behind each recommendation. This is the lowest cost, highest value accessory I could have purchased.
